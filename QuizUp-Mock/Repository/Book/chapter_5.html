		<h1 id="sigil_toc_id_145">Chapter 5: The UK government, the law and your role</h1>
		<p>In this chapter you will learn how the UK is governed. You need to understand the Queen's role in government and her
		powers. Make sure you understand how people are appointed to the two Houses of Parliament and the specific roles
		detailed, such as the Speaker and cabinet, and your rights to vote and stand for election. Everyone should
		understand the workings of the devolved administrations but pay particular attention if you are taking the test in
		Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p>The UK's international role is explained through the Commonwealth, EU and others so focus on the differences between
		these bodies and their member countries. The chapter then explains common laws, fundamental rights, policing and the
		courts of the UK. Pay particular attention to this so you know the differences between the various courts and
		offences they deal with. Finally the chapter deals with taxation, driving and community activity.</p>
		<p class="chapintro">IN THIS CHAPTER THERE IS INFORMATION ABOUT:</p>
		<ul class="chapintro">

		<p>The UK is a parliamentary democracy with the monarch as head of state. This section will tell you about the different
		institutions which make up this democratic system and explain how you can play a part in the democratic process.</p>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_146">The development of British democracy</h2>
		<p>Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say. This might be by direct voting or by
		choosing representatives to make decisions on their behalf.</p>
		<p>At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today. Although there were elections to
		select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small group of people could vote. They were men who were over 21 years of
		age and who owned a certain amount of property.</p>
		<p>The franchise (that is, the number of people who had the right to vote) grew over the course of the 19th century and
		political parties began to involve ordinary men and women as members.</p>
		<span id="14">
			<span id="189">
				<span id="652">
					<span id="426">
						<p>In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>For every man to have the vote</li>
							<li>Elections every year</li>
							<li>For all regions to be equal in the electoral system</li>
							<li>Secret ballots</li>
							<li>For any man to be able to stand as an MP</li>
							<li>For MPs to be paid.</li>
						</ul>
					</span>
				</span>
			</span>
		</span>
		<p>
		<span id="569"><span id="365"><span id="133"><span id="285">
			At the time, the campaign was generally seen as a failure. However, by 1918 most of these reforms had been adopted.
			<span id="712">The voting franchise was also extended to women over 30, and then in 1928 to men and women over 21.
				In 1969, the voting age was reduced to 18 for men and women.
			</span>
		</span></span></span></span>
		</p>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_147">The British constitution</h2>
		<p>A constitution is a set of principles by which a country is governed. It includes all of the institutions that are
		responsible for running the country and how their power is kept in check. The constitution also includes laws and
		conventions.
		<span id="499"><span id="162">
			The British constitution is not written down in any single document, and therefore it is described as 'unwritten'
		</span></span>.
		This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France, has never had a revolution which led
		permanently to a totally new system of government. Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of
		years. Some people believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten constitution
		allows for more flexibility and better government.
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_148">Constitutional institutions</h3>
		<span id="402">
			<p>In the UK, there are several different parts of government. The main ones are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The monarchy</li>
				<li>Parliament (the House of Commons and the House of Lords)</li>
				<li>The Prime Minister</li>
				<li>The cabinet</li>
				<li>The judiciary (courts)</li>
				<li>The police</li>
				<li>The civil service</li>
				<li>Local government</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<p>In addition, <span id="850">there are devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that have the power to legislate
			on certain issues.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_149">The monarchy</h3>
		<p><span id="117">Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK. She is also the monarch or head of state for many countries in the
			Commonwealth</span>.
		<span id="692"><span id="427">The UK has a constitutional monarchy. This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but
			appoints the government, which the people have chosen in a democratic election. The monarch invites the leader of
			the party with the largest number of MPs, or the leader of a coalition between more than one party, to become the
			Prime Minister. The monarch has regular meetings with the Prime Minister and can advise, warn and encourage, but the
			decisions on government policies are made by the Prime Minister and cabinet (see The government).</span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="742"><span id="617"><span id="21"><span id="517"><span id="263">
			The Queen has reigned since her father's death in 1952, and in 2012 she celebrated her Diamond Jubilee (60 years as
			queen). She is married to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.
			Her eldest son, Prince Charles (the Prince of Wales), is the heir to the throne.
		</span></span></span></span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="743"><span id="525"><span id="475"><span id="43">
			The Queen has important ceremonial roles, such as the opening of the new parliamentary session each year. On this
			occasion the Queen makes a speech which summarises the government's policies for the year ahead. All Acts of
			Parliament are made in her name.
		</span></span></span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="851">
			The Queen represents the UK to the rest of the world. She receives foreign ambassadors and high commissioners,
			entertains visiting heads of state, and makes state visits overseas in support of diplomatic and economic
			relationships with other countries.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>The Queen has an important role in providing stability and continuity. While governments and Prime Ministers change
		regularly, the Queen continues as head of state. She provides a focus for national identity and pride, which was
		demonstrated through the celebrations of her Jubilee.
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_150">The national anthem</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="90">
			The National Anthem of the UK is 'God Save the Queen'. It is played at important national occasions and at events
			attended by the Queen or the Royal Family.
		</span>
		The first verse is:
		</p>
		<span id="403">
			<p class="quote">'God save our gracious Queen!</p>
			<p class="quote">Long live our noble Queen!</p>
			<p class="quote">God save the Queen!</p>
			<p class="quote">Send her victorious,</p>
			<p class="quote">Happy and glorious,</p>
			<p class="quote">Long to reign over us,</p>
			<p class="quote">God save the Queen!'</p>
		</span>
		<p><span id="522">
			New citizens swear or affirm loyalty to the Queen as part of the citizenship ceremony.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Oath of allegiance</h5>
		<p class="quote">'I (name) swear by Almighty God that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear
		true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to
		law.'</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Affirmation of allegiance</h5>
		<p class="quote">'I (name) do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that on becoming a British citizen,
		I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and
		Successors, according to law.'</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_151">System of government</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="667">
			The system of government in the UK is a parliamentary democracy. The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies.
			Voters in each constituency elect their member of Parliament (MP) in a General Election. All of the elected MPs form
			the House of Commons. Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party with the majority of MPs forms the
			government. If one party does not get a majority, two parties can join together to form a coalition.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_152">The House of Commons</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="308">
			The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in Parliament because its members are
			democratically elected. The Prime Minister and almost all the members of the cabinet are members of the House of
			Commons (MPs). Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a small area of the country.
		</span>
		MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:</p>
		<span id="664">
			<span id="286">
				<ul>
					<li>represent everyone in their constituency</li>
					<li>help to create new laws</li>
					<li>scrutinise and comment on what the government is doing</li>
					<li>debate important national issues.</li>
				</ul>
			</span>
		</span>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_153">The House of Lords</h3>
		<span id="852">
			<p>Members of the House of Lords, known as peers, are not elected by the people and do not represent a constituency. The
			role and membership of the House of Lords has changed over the last 50 years.</p>
			<p>Until 1958, all peers were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'Hereditary', which means they inherited their title, or</li>
				<li>Senior judges, or</li>
				<li>Bishops of the Church of England.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<p><span id="672"><span id="665">
			Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime. These are called life
			peers. They have usually had an important career in politics, business, law or another profession.
			<span id="744"><span id="22">
				Life peers are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.
			</span></span>
		</span>
		</span>
		They also include people nominated by the leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
		</p>
		<p><span id="598">Since 1999, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the House of Lords. They now elect a few of
			their number to represent them in the House of Lords.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="663"><span id="572">The House of Lords is normally more independent of the government than the House of Commons. It can suggest
			amendments or propose new laws, which are then discussed by MPs. The House of Lords checks laws that have been
			passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit for purpose. It also holds the government to account to make
			sure that it is working in the best interests of the people.</span></span>
		There are peers who are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in making and checking laws.
		<span id="518">The House of Commons has powers to overrule the House of Lords, but these are not used often.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_154">The Speaker</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="549"><span id="428">
			Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the Speaker. This person is the chief Officer of the House of Commons.
			The Speaker is neutral and does not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents a
			constituency and deals with constituents' problems like any other MP. The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a secret
			ballot.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="538">
			The Speaker keeps order during political debates to make sure the rules are followed. This includes making sure the
			opposition (see The government) has a guaranteed amount of time to debate issues which it chooses. The Speaker
			also represents Parliament on ceremonial occasions.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_155">Elections</h3>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">UK elections</h5>
		<p>
		<span id="619"><span id="72">
			MPs are elected at a General Election, which is held at least every five years.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="548"><span id="143">
			If an MP dies or resigns, there will be a fresh election, called a by-election, in his or her constituency.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="520">
			MPs are elected through a system called 'first past the post'. In each constituency, the candidate who gets the most
			votes is elected. The government is usually formed by the party that wins the majority of constituencies. If no
			party wins a majority, two parties may join together to form a coalition.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">European parliamentary elections</h5>
		<p>
		<span id="425">
			Elections for the European Parliament are also held every five years. Elected members are called members of the
			European Parliament (MEPs).
		</span>
		Elections to the European Parliament use a system of proportional representation, where
		seats are allocated to each party in proportion to the total number of votes it has won.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_156">Contacting elected members</h3>
		<p>All elected members have a duty to serve and represent their constituents. You can get contact details for all your
		representatives and their parties from your local library and from www.parliament.uk. MPs, Assembly members,
		members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and MEPs are also listed in
		<i>The Phone Book</i>, published by BT, and in<i>Yellow
			Pages</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="971">
			You can contact MPs by letter. email, social media or telephone at their constituency Office, or at their Office in the House of Commons:
			The House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA, telephone 020 7729 3000. In addition, many MPs, Assembly
			members, MSPs and MEPs hold regular local 'surgeries', where constituents can go in person to talk about issues that
			are of concern to them. These surgeries are often advertised in the local newspaper.

		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_159">The Prime Minister</h3>
		<span id="44">
			<p>
			<span id="356">
				The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the political party in power. He or she appoints the members of the cabinet and has control over many important public appointments.
				<span id="287"><span id="539">The official home of the Prime Minister is
					10 Downing Street, in central London, near the Houses of Parliament. He or she also has a country house outside
					London called Chequers.
				</span></span>
			</span>
			</p>
		</span>
		<p>
		<span id="163">
			The Prime Minister can be changed if the MPs in the governing party decide to do so, or if he or she wishes to
			resign. The Prime Minister usually resigns if his or her party loses a General Election.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_160">The cabinet</h3>
		<span id="615">
			<p>The Prime Minister appoints about 20 senior MPs to become ministers in charge of departments. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span id="309">
						Chancellor of the Exchequer - Responsible for the economy
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span id="190">
						Home Secretary - Responsible for crime, policing and immigration
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					Foreign Secretary - Responsible for managing relationships with foreign countries
				</li>
				<li>
					<span id="91"><span id="429">
						Other ministers (called 'Secretaries of State') responsible for subjects such as education, health and defence.
					</span></span>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<p><span id="118">These ministers form the cabinet, a committee which usually meets weekly and makes important decisions about
			government policy. Many of these decisions have to be debated or approved by Parliament.</span></p>
		<p>Each department also has a number of other ministers, called Ministers of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries
		of State, who take charge of particular areas of the department's work.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_161">The opposition</h3>
		<p><span id="623">
			The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition. The leader of the opposition usually
			becomes Prime Minister if his or her party wins the next General Election.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="713">
			The leader of the opposition leads his or her party in pointing out what they see as the government's failures and
			weaknesses. One important opportunity to do this is at Prime Minister's Questions, which takes place every week
			while Parliament is sitting.
		</span>
		<span id="594"><span id="552">
			The leader of the opposition also appoints senior opposition MPs to be 'shadow
			ministers'. They form the shadow cabinet and <span id="200">their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.
			</span></span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_162">The party system</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="718">
			Anyone aged 18 or over can stand for election as an MP but they are unlikely to win unless they have been nominated
			to represent one of the major political parties.
			<span id="848">
				These are the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal
				Democrats, or one of the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
			</span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="357">
			There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties. They are called 'independents' and
			usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their debates, contribute to their costs,
		and help at elections for Parliament or for local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold
		policy-making conferences every year.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="191">
			Pressure and lobby groups are organisations which try to influence government policy. They play an important role in
			politics. Some are representative organisations such as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which
			represents the views of British business.
		</span>
		Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace) or human rights (for example, Liberty).
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_163">The civil service</h3>
		<p>Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies. They also deliver public services.
		Civil servants are accountable to ministers. They are chosen on merit and are politically neutral - they are not
		political appointees. People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other jobs in
		the UK.
		<span id="668"><span id="424">Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication and a commitment to the civil service
			and its core values. These are: integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality (including being politically neutral).
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_164">Local government</h3>
		<p><span id="669">
			Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils, often called 'local
			authorities'. Some areas have both district and county councils, which have different functions. Most large towns
			and cities have a single local authority.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas. They are funded by money from central government and by
		local taxes.</p>
		<p><span id="646">Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the ceremonial leader of the council. In some towns, a mayor is
			elected to be the effective leader of the administration.
		</span>
		<span id="240">London has 33 local authorities, with the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London coordinating policies across the capital.
		</span> For most local authorities, local elections for councillors are held in May every year. Many candidates stand
		for council election as members of a political party.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_165">Devolved administrations</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="784">
			<span id="621">
				Since 1997, some powers have been devolved from the central government to give people in Wales, Scotland and Northern
				Ireland more control over matters that directly affect them.
			</span>
			<span id="288">
				There has been a Welsh Assembly and a Scottish Parliament since 1999. There is also a Northern Ireland Assembly,
				although this has been suspended on a few occasions.
			</span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="696"><span id="502">
			Policy and laws governing defence, foreign affairs, immigration, taxation and social security all remain under
			central UK government control. However, many other public services, such as education, are controlled by the
			devolved administrations. The devolved administrations each have their own civil service.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The Welsh government</h5>
		<p>
		<span id="762"><span id="526"><span id="504"><span id="310">
			The Welsh government and National Assembly for Wales are based in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. The National
			Assembly has 60 Assembly members (AMs) and elections are held every four years using a form of proportional
			representation. Members can speak in either Welsh or English and all of the Assembly's publications are in both
			languages.
		</span></span></span></span>
		</p>
		<p>The Assembly has the power to make laws for Wales in 20 areas, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>education and training</li>
			<li>health and social services</li>
			<li>economic development</li>
			<li>housing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Since 2011, the National Assembly for Wales has been able to pass laws on these topics without the agreement of the
		UK Parliament.</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The Scottish Parliament</h5>
		<p><span id="264"><span id="430">
			The Scottish Parliament was formed in 1999. It sits in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="317">
			There are 129 members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), elected by a form of proportional representation.
		</span>
		<span id="550">
			The Scottish Parliament can pass laws for Scotland on all matters which are not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament.
		</span>
		The matters on which the Scottish Parliament can legislate include:

		<ul>
			<li>Civil and criminal law</li>
			<li>Health</li>
			<li>Education</li>
			<li>Planning</li>
			<li>Additional tax-raising powers.</li>

		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The Northern Ireland Assembly</h5>
		<p>
		<span id="845">
			A Northern Ireland Parliament was established in 1922, when Ireland was divided, but it was abolished in 1972,
			shortly after the Troubles broke out in 1969 (see The Partition of Ireland).
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="119">
			The Northern Ireland Assembly was established soon after the Belfast Agreement (or Good Friday Agreement) in 1998.
			There is a power-sharing agreement which distributes ministerial Offices amongst the main parties. The Assembly has
			108 elected members, known as MLAs (members of the Legislative Assembly).
		</span>
		They are elected with a form of proportional representation.
		</p>
		<p>The Northern Ireland Assembly can make decisions on issues such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Education</li>
			<li>Agriculture</li>
			<li>The environment</li>
			<li>Health</li>
			<li>Social services.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The UK government has the power to suspend all devolved assemblies. It has used this power several times in Northern
		Ireland when local political leaders found it difficult to work together. However, the Assembly has been running
		successfully since 2007.

		<p><span id="600"><span id="92"><span id="404">
			Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on television and published in official reports called <i>Hansard</i>.
			Written reports can be found in large libraries and at www.parliament.uk. Most people get information about

		</span></span></span>
		</p>
		<p>The UK has a free press. This means that what is written in newspapers is free from government control. Some

			present voting age of 18 was set in 1969 and (with a few exceptions) all UK-born and naturalised adult citizens have
			the right to vote.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="545">
			Adult citizens of the UK, and citizens of the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic who are resident in the UK, can
			vote in all public elections. Adult citizens of other EU states who are resident in the UK can vote in all elections

		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_169">The electoral register</h3>
		<p><span id="546"><span id="316">
			To be able to vote in a parliamentary, local or European election, you must have your name on the electoral
			register.</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local council electoral registration Office. This is
		usually based at your local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere). If you don't know which local authority
		you come under, you can find out by visiting www.aboutmyvote.co.uk and entering your postcode. You can also
		download voter registration forms in English, Welsh and some other languages.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="859">
			The electoral register is updated every year in September or October. An electoral registration form is sent to every
			household and this has to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident in the household and
			eligible to vote.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="865">
			In Northern Ireland a different system operates. This is called 'individual registration' and all those entitled to
			vote must complete their own registration form. Once registered, people stay on the register provided their personal
			details do not change.
		</span>
		For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website at www.eoni.org.uk
		</p>
		<p>By law, each local authority has to make its electoral register available for anyone to look at, although this has to
		be supervised. The register is kept at each local electoral registration Office (or council Office in England and
		Wales). It is also possible to see the register at some public buildings such as libraries.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_170">Where to vote</h3>
		<p>People vote in elections at places called polling stations, or polling places in Scotland. Before the election you
		will be sent a poll card. This tells you where your polling station or polling place is and when the election will
		take place. On election day, the polling station or place will be open from 7.00 am until 10.00 pm.</p>
		<p><span id="593"><span id="199">When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address. In Northern Ireland you will
			also have to show photographic identification.</span> You will then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling
			booth to fill in privately.</span> You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you vote
		for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on the ballot paper. Once you have completed it, put
		it in the ballot box.</p>
		<p>If it is difficult for you to get to a polling station or polling place, you can register for a postal ballot. Your
		ballot paper will be sent to your home before the election. You then fill it in and post it back. You can choose to
		do this when you register to vote.</p>

		<p><span id="697">One of the most important responsibilities of all residents in the UK is to know and obey the law. This section will
			tell you about the legal system in the UK and some of the laws that may affect you. Britain is proud of being a
			welcoming country, but all residents, regardless of their background, are expected to comply with the law and to
			understand that some things which may be allowed in other legal systems are not acceptable in the UK. Those who do
			not respect the law should not expect to be allowed to become permanent residents in the UK.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>The law is relevant to all areas of life in the UK. You should make sure that you are aware of the laws which affect
		your everyday life, including both your personal and business affairs.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_182">The law in the UK</h3>
		<p>Every person in the UK receives equal treatment under the law. This means that the law applies in the same way to
		everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from.</p>
		<p>Laws can be divided into criminal law and civil law:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Criminal law relates to crimes, which are usually investigated by the police or another authority such as a
				council, and which are punished by the courts.
			</li>
			<li>Civil law is used to settle disputes between individuals or groups.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Examples of criminal laws are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span id="405">Carrying a weapon: it is a criminal offence to carry a weapon of any kind, even if it is for self-defence. This
				includes a gun, a knife or anything that is made or adapted to cause injury.</span>
			</li>
			<li>Drugs:
				<span id="826">selling or buying drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis is illegal in the UK.</span>
			</li>
			<li>Racial crime: it is a criminal offence to cause harassment, alarm or distress to someone because of their
				religion or ethnic origin.
			</li>
			<li><span id="624"><span id="164">
				Selling tobacco: it is illegal to sell tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, roll-up tobacco) to anyone under the age of 18.
			</span></span>
			</li>
			<li>Smoking in public places: it is against the law to smoke tobacco products in nearly every enclosed public place
				in the UK. There are signs displayed to tell you where you cannot smoke.
			</li>
			<li>Buying alcohol: it is a criminal offence to sell alcohol to anyone who is under 18 or to buy alcohol for people
				who are under the age of 18. (There is one exception: people aged 16 or over can drink alcohol with a meal in a
				hotel or restaurant - see Pubs and Night Clubs.)
			</li>
			<li>Drinking in public: some places have alcohol-free zones where you cannot drink in public. The police can also
				confiscate alcohol or move young people on from public places. You can be fined or arrested.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This list does not include all crimes. There are many that apply in most countries, such as murder, theft and
		assault. You can find out more about types of crime in the UK at www.gov.uk.</p>
		<span id="197">
			<span id="541">
				<span id="643">
					<p>Examples of civil laws are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Housing law: this includes disputes between landlords and tenants over issues such as repairs and eviction.</li>
						<li>Consumer rights: an example of this is a dispute about faulty goods or services.</li>
						<li>Employment law: these cases include disputes over wages and cases of unfair dismissal or discrimination in the workplace.</li>
						<li>Debt: people might be taken to court if they owe money to someone.</li>
					</ul>
				</span>
			</span>
		</span>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_183">The police and their duties</h3>
		<span id="408">
			<p>The job of the police in the UK is to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Protect life and property</li>
				<li>Prevent disturbances (also known as keeping the peace)</li>
				<li>Prevent and detect crime.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<p>The police are organised into a number of separate police forces headed by Chief Constables. They are independent of
		the government.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="860">
			In November 2012, the public elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England and Wales. These are directly
			elected individuals who are responsible for the delivery of an efficient and effective police force that reflects
			the needs of their local communities.
		</span>
		<span id="312">
			PCCs set local police priorities and the local policing budget. They also appoint the Chief Constable.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>The police force is a public service that helps and protects everyone, no matter what their background or where they
		live. Police Officers must themselves obey the law. They must not misuse their authority, make a false statement, be
		rude or abusive, or commit racial discrimination. If police Officers are corrupt or misuse their authority they are
		severely punished.</p>
		<p>Police Officers are supported by police community support Officers (PSCOs). PSCOs have different roles according to
		the area but usually patrol the streets, work with the public, and support police Officers at crime scenes and major
		events.</p>
		<span id="45">
			<p>All people in the UK are expected to help the police prevent and detect crimes whenever they can. If you are arrested
			and taken to a police station, a police Officer will tell you the reason for your arrest and you will be able to
			seek legal advice.</p>
		</span>
		<p>If something goes wrong, the police complaints system tries to put it right.
		<span id="612"><span id="314">
			Anyone can make a complaint about the police by going to a police station or writing to the Chief
			Constable of the police force involved. Complaints can also be made to an independent body: the Independent Police
			Complaints Commission in England and Wales, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland or the Police Ombudsman
			for Northern Ireland.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_184">Terrorism and extremism</h3>
		<p>The UK faces a range of terrorist threats. The most serious of these is from Al Qa'ida, its affiliates and
		like-minded organisations. The UK also faces threats from other kinds of terrorism, such as Northern Ireland-related
		terrorism.</p>
		<p>All terrorist groups try to radicalise and recruit people to their cause. How, where and to what extent they try to
		do so will vary. Evidence shows that these groups attract very low levels of public support, but people who want to
		make their home in the UK should be aware of this threat. It is important that all citizens feel safe. This includes
		feeling safe from all kinds of extremism (vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values), including
		religious extremism and far-right extremism.
		</p>
		<p><span id="662">
			If you think someone is trying to persuade you to join an extremist or terrorist cause, you should notify your local
			police force.

		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_186">The role of the courts</h2>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_187">The judiciary</h3>
		<p><span id="93">
			Judges (who are together called 'the judiciary') are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that trials
			are conducted fairly.
		</span> The government cannot interfere with this.
		</p>
		<p>Sometimes the actions of the government are claimed to be illegal. If the judges agree, then the government must
		either change its policies or ask Parliament to change the law. If judges find that a public body is not respecting
		someone's legal rights, they can order that body to change its practices and/or pay compensation. Judges also make
		decisions in disputes between members of the public or organisations. These might be about contracts, property or
		employment rights or after an accident.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_188">Criminal courts</h3>
		<p>There are some differences between the court systems in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Magistrates' and Justice of the Peace Courts</h5>
		<p><span id="813">
			In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most minor criminal cases are dealt with in a Magistrates' Court. In
			Scotland, minor criminal offences go to a Justice of the Peace Court.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="640">
			Magistrates and Justices of the Peace (JPs) are members of the local community. In England, Wales and Scotland they
			usually work unpaid and do not need legal qualifications. They receive training to do the job and are supported by a
			legal adviser. Magistrates decide the verdict in each case that comes before them and, if the person is found
			guilty, the sentence that they are given.
		</span>
		<span id="694">
			<span id="519">In Northern Ireland, cases are heard by a District Judge or Deputy District Judge, who is legally qualified and paid.
			</span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Crown Courts and Sheriff Courts</h5>
		<p>In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, serious offences are tried in front of a judge and a jury in a Crown Court.
		In Scotland, serious cases are heard in a Sheriff Court with either a sheriff or a sheriff with a jury.
		<span id="94"><span id="423">The most serious cases in Scotland, such as murder, are heard at a High Court with a judge and jury.</span> A jury is made up of members of the public chosen at random from the local electoral register (see The Electoral Register).
			<span id="570"><span id="406"><span id="168">
				In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a jury has 12 members, and in Scotland a jury has 15 members.
			</span></span></span>
		</span>
		<span id="645"><span id="377">Everyone who is summoned to do jury service must do it unless they are not eligible (for example, because they have a criminal
			conviction) or they provide a good reason to be excused, such as ill health.</span>
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="846">
			The jury has to listen to the evidence presented at the trial and then decide a verdict of 'guilty' or 'not guilty'
			based on what they have heard. In Scotland, a third verdict of 'not proven' is also possible. If the jury finds a
			defendant guilty, the judge decides on the penalty.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Youth Courts</h5>
		<p>In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if an accused person is aged 10 to 17, the case is normally heard in a Youth
		Court in front of up to three specially trained magistrates or a District Judge. The most serious cases will go to
		the Crown Court.
		<span id="685"><span id="671">The parents or carers of the young person are expected to attend the hearing. Members of the public
			are not allowed in Youth Courts, and the name or photographs of the accused young person cannot be published in
			newspapers or used by the media.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p><span id="196"><span id="477">In Scotland a system called the Children's Hearings System is used to deal with children and young people who have
			committed an offence.</span></span></p>
		<p>Northern Ireland has a system of youth conferencing to consider how a child should be dealt with when they have
		committed an offence.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_189">Civil courts</h3>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">County Courts</h5>
		<p><span id="596">County Courts deal with a wide range of civil disputes. These include people trying to get back money that is owed to
			them, cases involving personal injury, family matters, breaches of contract, and divorce. In Scotland, most of these
			matters are dealt with in the Sheriff Court. More serious civil cases - for example, when a large amount of
			compensation is being claimed - are dealt with in the High Court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In
			Scotland, they are dealt with in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The small claims procedure</h5>
		<p>
		<span id="616"><span id="46"><span id="382">
			The small claims procedure is an informal way of helping people to settle minor disputes without spending a lot of
			time and money using a lawyer. This procedure is used for claims of less than £5,000 in England and Wales and £3,000 in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
		</span></span></span>
		The hearing is held in front of a judge in an ordinary room, and people from both
		sides of the dispute sit around a table. Small claims can also be issued online through Money Claims Online
		(www.moneyclaim.gov.uk).
		</p>
		<p>

		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_193">Equal opportunities</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="843">
			UK laws ensure that people are not treated unfairly in any area of life or work because of their age, disability,
			sex, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sexuality or marital status. If you face problems with
			discrimination, you can get more information from the Citizens Advice Bureau or from one of the following
			organisations:

		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_194">Domestic violence</h3>
		<p><span id="693">In the UK, brutality and violence in the home is a serious crime. Anyone who is violent towards their partner -
			whether they are a man or woman, married or living together - can be prosecuted. Any man who forces a woman to have
			sex, including a woman's husband, can be charged with rape.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="407">It is important for anyone facing domestic violence to get help as soon as possible. A solicitor or the Citizens
			Advice Bureau can explain the available options. In some areas there are safe places to go and stay in, called
			refuges or shelters.
		</span>
		There are emergency telephone numbers in the helpline section at the front of Yellow Pages,
		including, for women, the number of the nearest women's centre. You can also phone the 24-hour National Domestic
		Violence Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 at any time, or the police can help you find a safe place to stay.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_195">Female genital mutilation</h3>
		<p>Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as cutting or female circumcision, is illegal in the UK. Practising FGM
		or taking a girl or woman abroad for FGM is a criminal offence.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_196">Forced marriage</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="857">
			A marriage should be entered into with the full and free consent of both people involved. Arranged marriages, where
			both parties agree to the marriage, are acceptable in the UK.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="670">
			Forced marriage is where one or both parties do not or cannot give their consent to enter into the partnership.
			Forcing another person to marry is a criminal offence.
		</span></p>
		<p>
		<span id="542">
			Forced Marriage Protection Orders were introduced in 2008 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland under the Forced
			Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. Court orders can be obtained to protect a person from being forced into a
			marriage, or to protect a person in a forced marriage. Similar Protection Orders were introduced in Scotland in
			November 2011.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>A potential victim, or someone acting for them, can apply for an order. Anyone found to have breached an order can be
		jailed for up to two years for contempt of court.</p>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_197">Taxation</h2>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_198">Income tax</h3>
		<span id="359"><span id="378"><span id="523">
			<p>People in the UK have to pay tax on their income, which includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wages from paid employment</li>
				<li>Profits from self-employment</li>
				<li>Taxable benefits</li>
				<li>Pensions</li>
				<li>Income from property, savings and dividends.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		</span>
		</span>
		<p>Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="47">
			For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment by their
			employer and paid directly to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), the government department that collects taxes. This
			system is called 'Pay As You Earn' (PAYE).
		</span>
		<span id="524">If you are self-employed, you need to pay your own tax through a system
			called 'self-assessment', which includes completing a tax return. Other people may also need to complete a tax return.
		</span>
		If HMRC sends you a tax return, it is important to complete and return the form as soon as you have all the
		necessary information.</p>
		<p>You can find out more about income tax at www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax. You can get help and advice about taxes and
		completing tax forms from the HMRC self-assessment helpline, on 0845 300 0627, and the HMRC website at www.hmrc.gov.uk.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_199">National insurance</h3>
		<p>
		<span id="622"><span id="360"><span id="380">
			Almost everybody in the UK who is in paid work, including self-employed people, must pay National Insurance
			Contributions. The money raised from National Insurance Contributions is used to pay for state benefits and services
			such as the state retirement pension and the National Health Service (NHS).
			Employees have their National Insurance Contributions deducted from their pay by their employer. People who are
			self-employed need to pay National Insurance Contributions themselves.
			Anyone who does not pay enough National
			Insurance Contributions will not be able to receive certain contributory benefits such as Jobseeker's Allowance or a
			full state retirement pension.
			Some workers, such as part-time workers, may not qualify for statutory payments such
			as maternity pay if they do not earn enough.
		</span></span></span>
		</p>
		<p>Further guidance about National Insurance Contributions is available on HMRC's website
		at www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni.</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Getting a National Insurance number</h5>
		<p>A National Insurance number is a unique personal account number. It makes sure that the National Insurance
		Contributions and tax you pay are properly recorded against your name. All young people in the UK are sent a
		National Insurance number just before their 16th birthday.
		</p>
		<p>A non-UK national living in the UK and looking for work, starting work or setting up as self-employed will need a
		National Insurance number. However, you can start work without one.
		<span id="576">
			If you have permission to work in the UK, you
			will need to telephone the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to arrange to get a National Insurance number. You
			may be required to attend an interview. The DWP will advise you of the appropriate application process and tell you
			which documents you will need to bring to an interview if one is necessary.
		</span>
		You will usually need documents that prove your identity and that you have permission to work in the UK.
		A National Insurance number does not on its own prove to an employer that you have the right to work in the UK.
		</p>
		<p>You can find out more information about how to apply for a National Insurance number at www.gov.uk.
		</p>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_200">Driving</h2>
		<p>In the UK, you must be at least 17 years old to drive a car or motor cycle and you must have a driving licence to
		drive on public roads. To get a UK driving licence you must pass a driving test, which tests both your knowledge and
		your practical skills. You need to be at least 16 years old to ride a moped, and there are other age requirements
		and special tests for driving large vehicles.
		</p>
		<p>Drivers can use their driving licence until they are 70 years old. After that, the licence is valid for three years
		at a time.</p>
		<p><span id="686"><span id="165">
			In Northern Ireland, a newly qualified driver must display an 'R' place (for restricted driver) for one year after
			passing the test.
		</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="120">
			If your driving licence is from a country in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, you can drive
			in the UK for as long as your licence is valid.
		</span>
		If you have a licence from any other country, you may use it in the
		UK for up to 12 months. To continue driving after that, you must get a UK full driving licence.
		</p>
		<p>If you are resident in the UK, your car or motor cycle must be registered at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
		(DVLA).
		<span id="381">
			You must pay an annual road tax and display the tax disc, which shows that the tax has been paid, on the
			windscreen. You must also have valid motor insurance. It is a serious criminal offence to drive without insurance.
			<span id="547">
				<span id="592"><span id="194">
					If your vehicle is over three years old, you must take it for a Ministry of Transport (MOT) test every year.
				</span>
					It is an offence not to have an MOT certificate if your vehicle is more than three years old.
				</span></span></span>
		You can find out more about vehicle tax and MOT requirements from www.gov.uk.

		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_202">Your role in the community</h2>
		<p>Becoming a British citizen or settling in the UK brings responsibilities but also opportunities. Everyone has the
		opportunity to participate in their community. This section looks at some of the responsibilities of being a citizen
		and gives information about how you can help to make your community a better place to live and work.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_203">Values and responsibilities</h3>
		<span id="698">
			<span id="3">
				<span id="553">
					<p>Although Britain is one of the world's most diverse societies, there is a set of shared values and responsibilities
					that everyone can agree with. These values and responsibilities include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To obey and respect the law</li>
						<li>To be aware of the rights of others and respect those rights</li>
						<li>To treat others with fairness</li>
						<li>To behave responsibly</li>
						<li>To help and protect your family</li>
						<li>To respect and preserve the environment</li>
						<li>To treat everyone equally, regardless of sex, race, religion, age, disability, class or sexual orientation</li>
						<li>To work to provide for yourself and your family</li>
						<li>To help others</li>
						<li>To vote in local and national government elections.</li>
					</ul>
				</span>
			</span>
		</span>
		<p>Taking on these values and responsibilities will make it easier for you to become a full and active citizen.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_204">Being a good neighbour</h3>
		<p><span id="618">When you move into a new house or apartment, introduce yourself to the people who live near you. Getting to know your
			neighbours can help you to become part of the community and make friends. Your neighbours are also a good source of
			help - for example, they may be willing to feed your pets if you are away, or offer advice on local shops and
			services.</span>
		</p>
		<p>You can help prevent any problems and conflicts with your neighbours by respecting their privacy and limiting how
		much noise you make. Also try to keep your garden tidy, and only put your refuse bags and bins on the street or in
		communal areas if they are due to be collected.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_205">Getting involved in local activities</h3>
		<p>Volunteering and helping your community are an important part of being a good citizen. They enable you to integrate
		and get to know other people. It helps to make your community a better place if residents support each other. It
		also helps you to fulfil your duties as a citizen, such as behaving responsibly and helping others.</p>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_206">How you can support your community</h2>
		<p>There are a number of positive ways in which you can support your community and be a good citizen.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_207">Jury service</h3>
		<p><span id="766">
			As well as getting the right to vote, people on the electoral register are randomly selected to serve on a jury.
			Anyone who is on the electoral register and is aged 18 to 70 can be asked to do this.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_208">Helping in schools</h3>
		<p>If you have children, there are many ways in which you can help at their schools. Parents can often help in
		classrooms, by supporting activities or listening to children read.
		</p>
		<p><span id="516"><span id="166">
			Many schools organise events to raise money for extra equipment or out-of-school activities. Activities might include
			book sales, toy sales or bringing food to sell.
		</span></span>
		You might have good ideas of your own for raising money.
		<span id="824">
			Sometimes events are organised by parent-teacher associations (PTAs). Volunteering to help with their events or
			joining the association is a way of doing something good for the school and also making new friends in your local
			community. You can find out about these opportunities from notices in the school or notes your children bring home.
		</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">School governors and school boards</h5>
		<p>School governors, or members of the school board in Scotland, are people from the local community who wish to make a
		positive contribution to children's education. They must be aged 18 or over at the date of their election or
		appointment. There is no upper age limit.
		</p>
		<span id="500">
			<p>Governors and school boards have an important part to play in raising school standards. They have three key roles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting the strategic direction of the school</li>
				<li>Ensuring accountability</li>
				<li>Monitoring and evaluating school performance.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<p>You can contact your local school to ask if they need a new governor or school board member. In England, you can also
		apply online at the School Governors' One-Stop Shop at www.sgoss.org.uk. In England, parents and other
		community groups can apply to open a free school in their local area. More information about this can be found on
		the Department for Education website at www.dfe.gov.uk.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_209">Supporting political parties</h3>
		<p>Political parties welcome new members. Joining one is a way to demonstrate your support for certain views and to get
		involved in the democratic process.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="647">
			Political parties are particularly busy at election times. Members work hard to persuade people to vote for their
			candidates - for instance, by handing out leaflets in the street or by knocking on people's doors and asking for
			their support. This is called 'canvassing'.
		</span>
		You don't have to tell a canvasser how you intend to vote if you don't want to.
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="825">
			British citizens can stand for Office as a local councillor, a member of Parliament (or the devolved equivalents) or
			a member of the European Parliament. This is an opportunity to become even more involved in the political life of
			the UK. You may also be able to stand for Office if you are an Irish citizen, an eligible Commonwealth citizen or
			(except for standing to be an MP) a citizen of another EU country.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>You can find out more about joining a political party from the individual party websites.</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_210">Helping with local services</h3>
		<p>There are opportunities to volunteer with a wide range of local service providers, including local hospitals and
		youth projects. Services often want to involve local people in decisions about the way in which they work.
		Universities, housing associations, museums and arts councils may advertise for people to serve as volunteers in
		their governing bodies.</p>
		<p>
		<span id="847">
			You can volunteer with the police, and become a special constable or a lay (non-police) representative. You can also
			apply to become a magistrate. You will often find advertisements for vacancies in your local newspaper or on local
			radio.
		</span>
		You can also find out more about these sorts of roles at www.gov.uk.
		</p>
		<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_211">Blood and organ donation</h3>
		<p><span id="639"><span id="167">
			Donated blood is used by hospitals to help people with a wide range of injuries and illnesses. Giving blood only
			takes about an hour to do.
		</span></span>
		You can register to give blood at:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>England and North Wales: www.blood.co.uk</li>
			<li>Rest of Wales: www.welsh-blood.org.uk</li>
			<li>Scotland: www.scotblood.co.uk</li>
			<li>Northern Ireland: www.nibts.org</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		<span id="573">Many people in the UK are waiting for organ transplants. If you register to be an organ donor, it can make it easier
			for your family to decide whether to donate your organs when you die. You can register to be an organ donor at www.organdonation.nhs.uk.
			Living people can also donate a kidney.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>Other ways to volunteer</p>
		<p><span id="661"><span id="501">Volunteering is working for good causes without payment. There are many benefits to volunteering, such as meeting new
			people helping make your community a better place. Some volunteer activities will give you a chance to practise your
			English or develop work skills that will help you find a job or improve your curriculum vitae (CV). Many people
			volunteer simply because they want to help other people.</span></span>
		</p>
		<p>Activities you can do as a volunteer include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Working with animals - for example, caring for animals at a local rescue shelter</li>
			<li>Youth work - for example, volunteering at a youth group</li>
			<li>Helping improve the environment - for example, participating in a litter pick-up in the local area</li>
			<li>Working with the homeless in, for example, a homelessness shelter</li>
			<li>Mentoring - for example, supporting someone who has just come out of prison</li>
			<li>Work in health and hospitals - for example, working on an information desk in a hospital</li>
			<li>Helping older people at, for example, a residential care home.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are thousands of active charities and voluntary organisations in the UK. They work to improve the lives of
		people, animals and the environment in many different ways. They range from the British branches of international
		organisations, such as the British Red Cross, to small local charities working in particular areas. They include
		charities working with older people (such as Age UK), with children (for example, <span id="574"><span id="95">the National Society for the
			Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC))</span></span>, and with the homeless (for example, Crisis and Shelter).
		<span id="384">There are also
			medical research charities (for example, Cancer Research UK), environmental charities (including the National Trust
			and Friends of the Earth) and charities working with animals (such as the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals
			(PDSA)).</span></p>
		<p>Volunteers are needed to help with their activities and to raise money. The charities often advertise in local
		newspapers, and most have websites that include information about their opportunities. You can also get information
		about volunteering for different organisations from www.do-it.org.uk.</p>
		<p><span id="544"><span id="193">
			There are many opportunities for young people to volunteer and receive accreditation which will help them to develop
			their skills. These include the National Citizen Service programme, which gives 16- and 17-year-olds the opportunity
			to enjoy outdoor activities, develop their skills and take part in a community project.
		</span></span>
		You can find out more about these opportunities as follows:</p>

			<li>Northern Ireland: at www.volunteernow.co.uk</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_212">Looking after the environment</h2>
		<p><span id="575">It is important to recycle as much of your waste as you can. Using recycled materials to make new products uses less
			energy and means that we do not need to extract more raw materials from the earth. It also means that less rubbish
			is created, so the amount being put into landfill is reduced.</span>
		</p>
		<p>You can learn more about recycling and its benefits at www.recyclenow.com. At this website you can also find out
		what you can recycle at home and in the local area if you live in England. This information is available for Wales
		at www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk, for Scotland at www.recycleforscotland.com and for Northern
		Ireland from your local authority.
		</p>
		<p>
		<span id="666">
			A good way to support your local community is to shop for products locally where you can. This will help businesses
			and farmers in your area and in Britain. It will also reduce your carbon footprint, because the products you buy
			will not have had to travel as far.
		</span>
		</p>
		<p>Walking and using public transport to get around when you can is also a good way to protect the environment. It means
		that you create less pollution than when you use a car.
