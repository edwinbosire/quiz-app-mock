	won medals and for what as well as the general information about sport in the UK. Make sure you familiarise yourself
	with the poems, films, books and other works listed too, as well as the artists, composers, architects, authors,
	poets and other famous people. You should also familiarise yourself with the extracts of poems provided and be able

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_93">The UK today</h2>
<p>The UK today is a more diverse society than it was 100 years ago, in both ethnic and religious terms.
    <span id="658"><span id="65">
        Post-war immigration means that nearly 10% of the population has a parent or grandparent born outside the UK.
    </span></span>
	The UK continues to be a multinational and multiracial society with a rich and varied culture.
	This section will tell you about the different parts of the UK and some of the important places. It will also explain some of the UK's
	traditions customs and some of the popular activities that take place.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_94">The nations of the UK</h3>
<span id="987">
<p>The UK is located in the north west of Europe.
    <span id="275">
        The longest distance on the mainland is from John O'Groats on the
    north coast of Scotland to Land's End in the south-west corner of England. It is about 870 miles (approximately
    1,400 kilometres).
    </span>
	Most people live in towns and cities but much of Britain is still countryside. Many people
	continue to visit the countryside for holidays and for leisure activities such as walking, camping and fishing.

<p>In Scotland, Gaelic is spoken in some parts of the Highlands and Islands, and in Northern Ireland some people speak
	Irish Gaelic.</p>
<p>Population growth has been faster in more recent years. Migration into the UK and longer life expectancy have played
	a part in population growth.</p>
<p><span id="761"><span id="565"><span id="136"><span id="276"><span id="319"><span id="455"><span id="590">
    The population is very unequally distributed over the four parts of the UK. England more or less consistently makes
    up 84% of the total population, Wales around 5%, Scotland just over 8% and Northern Ireland less than 3%.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_98">An ageing population</h3>
<p><span id="210">
    People in the UK are living longer than ever before. This is due to improved living standards and better health care.
    There are now a record number of people aged 85 and over. This has an impact on the cost of pensions and health
    care.
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_99">Ethnic diversity</h3>
<p>The UK population is ethnically diverse and changing rapidly, especially in large cities such as London. It is not
	always easy to get an exact picture of the ethnic origin of all the population. There are people in the UK with
	ethnic origins from all over the world. In surveys, the most common ethnic description chosen is white, which
	includes people of European, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American descent. Other significant groups are
	those of Asian, black and mixed descent.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_100">An equal society</h3>
<p>Within the UK, it is a legal requirement that men and women should not be discriminated against because of their
	gender or because they are, or are not, married. They have equal rights to work, own property, marry and divorce. If
	they are married, both parents are equally responsible for their children.
</p>
<p><span id="789"><span id="157"><span id="470">
    Women in Britain today make up about half of the workforce. On average, girls leave school with better qualifications
    than boys. More women than men study at university.
</span></span></span>
</p>
<p>Employment opportunities for women are much greater than they were in the past. Women work in all sectors of the
	economy, and there are now more women in high-level positions than ever before, including senior managers in
	traditionally male-dominated occupations. Alongside this, men now work in more varied jobs than they did in the
	past.</p>
<p>It is no longer expected that women should stay at home and not work. Women often continue to work after having
	children. In many families today, both partners work and both share responsibility for childcare and household
	chores.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_102">Religion</h2>
<p>The UK is historically a Christian country.
    <span id="733"><span id="85"><span id="605"><span id="300">
        In the 2009 Citizenship Survey, 70% of people identified themselves as Christian. Much smaller proportions
        identified themselves as Muslim (4%), Hindu (2%), Sikh (1%)
    </span></span></span></span>,
    <span id="471">Jewish or Buddhist
    (both less than 0.5%), and 2% of people followed another religion.
    </span>
	There are religious buildings for other religions all over the UK. This includes Islamic mosques, Hindu temples,
	Jewish synagogues, Sikh gurdwaras and Buddhist temples. However, everyone has the legal right to choose their religion,
	or to choose not to practise a religion.
    <span id="347">
        In the Citizenship Survey, 21% of people said that they had no religion.
    </span>
</p>
<div>
	<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_103">Christian Churches</h3>
</div>
<span id="35">
<p>In England, there is a constitutional link between Church and state.
    <span id="628"><span id="183">The official Church of the state is the Church of England (called the Anglican
        Church in other countries and the Episcopal Church in Scotland and the United States)</span>
    </span>.
	It is a Protestant Church and has existed since the Reformation in the 1530s (see Religious Conflicts for an explanation).
</p>
</span>
<p>
    <span id="66">
        The monarch is the head of the Church of England. The spiritual leader of the Church of England is the Archbishop of
    Canterbury. The monarch has the right to select the Archbishop and other senior church officials, but usually the
    choice is made by the Prime Minister and a committee appointed by the Church.
    </span>
	Several Church of England bishops sit in the House of Lords (see House of Lords).
</p>
<p><span id="760"><span id="734">
    In Scotland, the national Church is the Church of Scotland, which is a Presbyterian Church. It is governed by
    ministers and elders. The chairperson of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator, who is
    appointed for one year only and often speaks on behalf of that Church.
</span></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="277">There is no established Church in Wales or Northern Ireland. Other <span id="556">Protestant Christian groups in the UK are
    Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians and Quakers. There are also other denominations of Christianity, the biggest of
    which is Roman Catholic.

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_104">Patron Saints' days</h3>
<p>England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a national saint, called a patron saint. Each saint has a special day:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 March: St David's Day, Wales</li>
	<li>17 March: St Patrick's Day, Northern Ireland</li>
	<li>23 April: St George's Day, England</li>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_107">The main Christian festivals</h3>
<span id="12">
<p>
    <span id="707"><b>Christmas Day</b>, 25 December, celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a public holiday. Many Christians go
    to church on Christmas Eve (24 December) or on Christmas Day itself.
</span>
</p>
</span>
<p><span id="604">
    Christmas is celebrated in a traditional way. People usually spend the day at home and eat a special meal, which
    often includes roast turkey, Christmas pudding and mince pies. They give gifts, send cards and decorate their
    houses. Christmas is a special time for children. Very young children believe that Father Christmas (also known as
    Santa Claus) brings them presents during the night before Christmas Day. Many people decorate a tree in their
    home.
</span>
</p>
<p><span id="607"><span id="67"><b>Boxing Day</b> is the day after Christmas Day and is a public holiday.</span></span>
</p>
<p><b>Easter</b> takes place in March or April. It marks the death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday and his rising from
	the dead on Easter Sunday. Both Good Friday and the following Monday, called Easter Monday, are public holidays.</p>
<span id="36">
<p><span id="400">The 40 days before Easter are known as Lent. It is a time when Christians take time to reflect and prepare for
    Easter. Traditionally, people would fast during this period and today many people will give something up, like a
    favourite food.</span>
    <span id="184">The day before Lent starts is called Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Day. People eat pancakes, which were
        traditionally made to use up foods such as eggs, fat and milk before fasting.</span>
	<span id="511">Lent begins on Ash Wednesday.</span> There
	are church services where Christians are marked with an ash cross on their forehead as a symbol of death and sorrow
	for sin.</p>
</span>
<p><span id="533">Easter is also celebrated by people who are not religious. 'Easter eggs' are chocolate eggs often given as presents
    at Easter as a symbol of new life.</span></p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_108">Other religious festivals</h3>
<p>
    <span id="241">
        <b>Diwali</b> normally falls in October or November and lasts for five days.
        <span id="786"><span id="278">
            It is often called the Festival of Lights. It is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs.
        </span></span>
        It celebrates the victory of good over evil and the gaining of knowledge.
    </span>
	There are different stories about how the festival came about. There is a famous celebration of Diwali in
	Leicester.
</p>
<p><span id="587"><span id="158">
    <b>Hannukah</b> is in November or December and is celebrated for eight days. It is to remember the Jews' struggle for
    religious freedom. On each day of the festival a candle is lit on a stand of eight candles (called a menorah) to
    remember the story of the festival, where oil that should have lasted only a day did so for eight.
</span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="209">
    <b>Eid al-Fitr</b> celebrates the end of Ramadan, when Muslims have fasted for a month. They thank Allah for giving
    them the strength to complete the fast. The date when it takes place changes every year. Muslims attend special
    services and meals.
</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="854">
        <b>Eid ul Adha</b> remembers that the prophet Ibrahim was willing to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to. It
    reminds Muslims of their own commitment to God. Many Muslims sacrifice an animal to eat during this festival. In
    Britain this has to be done in a slaughterhouse.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="348">
    <b>Vaisakhi</b> (also spelled Baisakhi) is a Sikh festival which celebrates the founding of the Sikh community known
    as the Khalsa. It is celebrated on 14 April each year with parades, dancing and singing.
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_109">Other festivals and traditions</h3>
<p><b>New Year</b>, 1 January, is a public holiday. People usually celebrate on the night of 31 December (called New
	Year's Eve). In Scotland, 31 December is called Hogmanay and 2 January is also a public holiday. For some Scottish
	people, Hogmanay is a bigger holiday than Christmas.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="112"><span id="510">
        <b>Valentine's Day</b>, 14 February, is when lovers exchange cards and gifts. Sometimes people send anonymous cards
    to someone they secretly admire.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="585">
    <b>April Fool's Day</b>, 1 April, is a day when people play jokes on each other until midday.
    The television and newspapers often have stories that are April Fool jokes.
</span>
</p>
<p><span id="736">
    <b>Mothering Sunday</b> (or Mother's Day) is the Sunday three weeks before Easter. Children send cards or buy gifts for their mothers.
</span>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Father's Day</b> is the third Sunday in June. Children send cards or buy gifts for their fathers.</p>
<p>
    <span id="660"><span id="608"><span id="86"><span id="508">
        <b>Halloween</b>,
    31 October, is an ancient festival and has roots in the pagan festival to mark the beginning of
    winter. Young people will often dress up in frightening costumes to play 'trick or treat'.
    People give them treats to stop them playing tricks on them. A lot of people carve lanterns out of pumpkins and put a candle inside.
</span></span></span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="708"><span id="234">
    <b>Bonfire Night</b>, 5 November, is an occasion when people in Great Britain set off fireworks at home or in special
    displays. The origin of this celebration was an event in 1605, when a group of Catholics led by Guy Fawkes failed in
    their plan to kill the Protestant king with a bomb in the Houses of Parliament.
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p><span id="656"><span id="513"><span id="279">
    <b>Remembrance Day</b>, 11 November, commemorates those who died fighting for the UK and its allies. Originally it
    commemorated the dead of the First World War, which ended on 11 November 1918. People wear poppies (the red flower
    found on the battlefields of the First World War). At 11.00 am there is a two-minute silence and wreaths are laid at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.
    </span></span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_110">Bank holidays</h3>
<p>
    <span id="855">
        As well as those mentioned previously, there are other public holidays each year called bank holidays, when banks and
    many other businesses are closed for the day. These are of no religious significance. They are at the beginning of
    May, in late May or early June, and in August. In Northern Ireland, the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in
    July is also a public holiday.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_112">Sport</h2>
<p>Sports of all kinds play an important part in many people's lives. There are several sports that are particularly
	popular in the UK. <span id="138">Many sporting events take place at major stadiums such as Wembley Stadium in London and the
        Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.
    </span>
</p>
<p>Local governments and private companies provide sports facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, football
	pitches, dry ski slopes and gymnasiums. Many famous sports, including cricket, football, lawn tennis, golf and
	rugby, began in Britain.
</p>
<p>
	<span id="737"><span id="159">The UK has hosted the Olympic Games on three occasions: 1908, 1948 and 2012.</span></span>
	The main Olympic site for the 2012 Games was in Stratford, East London. The British team was very successful, across a
	wide range of Olympic sports, finishing third in the medal table.
</p>
<p><span id="819">
    The Paralympic Games for 2012 were also hosted in London. The Paralympics have their origin in the work of Dr Sir
    Ludwig Guttman, a German refugee, at the Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire. Dr Guttman developed new
    methods of treatment for people with spinal injuries and encouraged patients to take part in exercise and sport.

        Cricket originated in England and is now played in many countries. Games can last up to five days but still result in
    a draw!
    </span>
    <span id="827">
    The idiosyncratic nature of the game and its complex laws are said to reflect the best of the British
    character and sense of fair play. You may come across expressions such as 'rain stopped play', 'batting on a sticky
    wicket', 'playing a straight bat', 'bowled a googly' or 'it's just not cricket', which have passed into everyday
    usage. The most famous competition is the Ashes, which is a series of Test matches played between England and

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_122">Arts and culture</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_123">Music</h3>
<p>Music is an important part of British culture, with a rich and varied heritage. It ranges from classical music to
	modern pop. There are many different venues and musical events that take place across the UK.</p>
<p><span id="17">
	The Proms is an eight-week summer season of orchestral classical music that takes place in various venues, including
	the Royal Albert Hall in London. It has been organised by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) since 1927. The
	Last Night of the Proms is the most well-known concert and (along with others in the series) is broadcast on
	television.
</span>
</p>
<p>Classical music has been popular in the UK for many centuries.
    <span id="25"><b>Henry Purcell (1659-95)</b> was the organist at
    Westminster Abbey. He wrote church music, operas and other pieces, and developed a British style distinct from that
    elsewhere in Europe. He continues to be influential on British composers.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="335">
    The German-born composer <b>George Frederick Handel (1695-1759)</b> spent many years in the UK and became a British
    citizen in 1727. He wrote the <i>Water Music</i> for King George I and <i>Music for the Royal Fireworks</i> for his
    son, George II.
    Both these pieces continue to be very popular. Handel also wrote an oratorio, <i>Messiah</i>, which
    is sung regularly by choirs, often at Easter time.
</span>
</p>
<p>More recently, <span id="709">important composers include <b>Gustav Holst (1874-1934)</b>, whose work includes <i>The Planets</i>, a
    suite of pieces themed around the planets of the solar system. He adapted <i>Jupiter</i>, part of the Planets suite,
    as the tune for <i>I vow to thee my country</i>, a popular hymn in British churches.
</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="866">
        <b>Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934)</b> was born in Worcester, England. His best-known work is probably the <i>Pomp and
	    Circumstance Marches. March No 1 (Land of Hope and Glory)</i> is usually played at the Last Night of the Proms at
    the Royal Albert Hall.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="837">
        <b>Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)</b> wrote music for orchestras and choirs. He was strongly influenced by
    traditional English folk music.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="562">
        <b>Sir William Walton (1902-83)</b> wrote a wide range of music, from film scores to opera. He wrote marches for the
    coronations of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II but his best-known works are probably <i>Façade</i>, which
    became a ballet, and <i>Balthazar's Feast</i>, which is intended to be sung by a large choir.
    </span>
</p>
<p><b>Benjamin Britten (1913-76)</b> is best known for his operas, which include <i>Peter Grimes</i> and <i>Billy
	Budd</i>. He also wrote <i>A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra</i>, which is based on a piece of music by
	Purcell and introduces the listener to the various different sections of an orchestra. He founded the Aldeburgh
	festival in Suffolk, which continues to be a popular music event of international importance.</p>
<p>Other types of popular music, including folk music, jazz, pop and music, have flourished in Britain since the 20th
	century. Britain has had an impact on popular music around the world, due to the wide use of the English language,
	the UK's cultural links with many countries, and British capacity for invention and innovation. Since the 1960s,
	British pop music has made one of the most important cultural contributions to life in the UK. Bands including The
	Beatles and The Rolling Stones continue to have an influence on music both here and abroad. British pop music has
	continued to innovate - for example, the Punk movement of the late 1970s, and the trend towards boy and girl bands
	in the 1990s.
</p>
<p><span id="563"><span id="186"><span id="69">
    There are many large venues that host music events throughout the year, such as: Wembley Stadium; The O2 in
    Greenwich, south-east London; and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow.
</span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<span id="1026">
	Festival season takes place across the UK every summer, with major events in various locations. Famous festivals
	include Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight Festival and the V Festival. Many bands and solo artists, both well-known and

    annual event that gives awards in a range of categories, such as best British group and best British solo
    artist.
</span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_124">Theatre</h3>
<p>
    <span id="951">
        There are theatres in most towns and cities throughout the UK, ranging from the large to the small. They are an
    important part of local communities and often show both professional and amateur productions. London's West End,
    also known as 'Theatreland', is particularly well known. <i>The Mousetrap</i>, a murder-mystery play by Dame Agatha
    Christie, has been running in the West End since 1952 and has had the longest initial run of any show in history.
    </span>
</p>
<p>There is also a strong tradition of musical theatre in the UK.
    <span id="566">
        In the 19th century, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote comic operas, often making fun of popular culture and politics.
    <span id="87">These operas include <i>HMS Pinafore</i>, <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> and <i>The Mikado</i>
    </span>
</span>.
	Gilbert and Sullivan's work is still often staged by professional and
	amateur groups. More recently, <span id="710">Andrew Lloyd Webber has written the music for shows which have been popular
    throughout the world, including, in collaboration with Tim Rice, <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> and <i>Evita</i>, and also <i>Cats</i> and <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="534"><span id="304">
    One British tradition is the pantomime. Many theatres produce a pantomime at Christmas time. They are based on fairy
    stories and are light-hearted plays with music and comedy, enjoyed by family audiences. One of the traditional
    characters is the Dame, a woman played by a man. There is often also a pantomime horse or cow played by two actors
    in the same costume.
</span></span>
</p>
<span id="39">
<p>The Edinburgh Festival takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, every summer. It is a series of different arts and
	cultural festivals, with the biggest and most well-known being the Edinburgh Festival Fringe ('the Fringe').
    <span id="113">The Fringe is a showcase of mainly theatre and comedy performances. It often shows experimental work.
    </span></p>

<p>
    <span id="160">
    The Laurence Olivier Awards take place annually at different venues in London. There are a variety of categories,
    including best director, best actor and best actress.
    The awards are named after the British actor Sir Laurence
    Olivier, later Lord Olivier, who was best known for his roles in various Shakespeare plays.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_125">Art</h3>
<p>During the Middle Ages, most art had a religious theme, particularly wall paintings in churches and illustrations in
	religious books. Much of this was lost after the Protestant Reformation but wealthy families began to collect other
	paintings and sculptures.
    <span id="571">
        Many of the painters working in Britain in the 16th and 17th centuries were from abroad -
    for example, Hans Holbein and Sir Anthony Van Dyck. British artists, particularly those painting portraits and
        landscapes, became well known from the 18th century onwards.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span id="972">
		Works by British and international artists are displayed in galleries across the UK. Some of the most well-known

</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_126" class="box">Architecture</h3>
<p>The architectural heritage of the UK is rich and varied. <span id="261">In the Middle Ages, great cathedrals and churches were
    built, many of which still stand today. Examples are the cathedrals in Durham, Lincoln, Canterbury and Salisbury.
    The White Tower in the Tower of London is an example of a Norman castle keep, built on the orders of William the
        Conqueror (see The Norman Conquest and The Tower of London).</span></p>
<p>Gradually, as the countryside became more peaceful and landowners became richer, the houses of the wealthy became
	more elaborate and great country houses such as Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire were built. British styles of
	architecture began to evolve.</p>
<p>
	<span id="1018">
		In the 17th century, Inigo Jones took inspiration from classical architecture to design the Queen's House at
	Greenwich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall in London. Later in the century, Sir Christopher Wren helped develop
	a British version of the ornate styles popular in Europe in buildings such as the new St Paul's Cathedral.
		</span>
</p>
<p>In the 18th century, simpler designs became popular.
    <span id="350">
        The Scottish architect Robert Adam influenced the development of
    architecture in the UK, Europe and America. He designed the inside decoration as well as the building itself in
    great houses such as Dumfries House in Scotland. His ideas influenced architects in cities such as Bath, where the
    Royal Crescent was built.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="70">
    In the 19th century, the medieval 'gothic' style became popular again. As cities expanded, many great public
    buildings were built in this style. The Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station were built at this time, as were
    the town halls in cities such as Manchester and Sheffield.
</span>
</p>
<span id="16">
<p><span id="512"><span id="187"><span id="336">
    In the 20th century, Sir Edwin Lutyens had an influence throughout the British Empire. He designed New Delhi to be
    the seat of government in India. After the First World War, he was responsible for many war memorials throughout the
    world, including the Cenotaph in Whitehall.
</span></span></span>
	The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Remembrance Day service attended by the Queen, politicians and foreign ambassadors (see The Cenotaph).
</p>
</span>
<p>Modern British architects including Sir Norman Foster, Lord (Richard) Rogers and Dame Zaha Hadid continue to work on
	major projects throughout the world as well as within the UK.</p>
<p>
	<span id="1012">
		Alongside the development of architecture, garden design and landscaping have played an important role in the UK. In
	the 18th century, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown designed the grounds around country houses so that the landscape
	appeared to be natural, with grass, trees and lakes. He often said that a place had 'capabilities'. Later, Gertrude
	Jekyll often worked with Edwin Lutyens to design colourful gardens around the houses he designed. Gardens continue
	to be an important part of homes in the UK. The annual Chelsea Flower Show showcases garden design from Britain and
	around the world.

</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_127">Fashion and design</h3>
<p><span id="684">Britain has produced many great designers, from Thomas Chippendale (who designed furniture in the 18th century) to
    Clarice Cliff (who designed Art Deco ceramics) to Sir Terence Conran (a 20th-century interior designer). Leading
    fashion designers of recent years include Mary Quant, Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood.

    <span id="305">
        British poetry is among the richest in the world. The Anglo-Saxon poem <i>Beowulf</i> tells of its hero's battles
    against monsters and is still translated into modern English.
    </span>
	Poems which survive from the Middle Ages include Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and a poem called
	<i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, about one of the knights at the court of King Arthur.
</p>
<p>As well as plays, Shakespeare wrote many sonnets (poems which must be 14 lines long) and some longer poems. As
	Protestant ideas spread, a number of poets wrote poems inspired by their religious views. One of these was John
	Milton, who wrote <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="856">
        Other poets, including William Wordsworth, were inspired by nature. Sir Walter Scott wrote poems inspired by Scotland
    and the traditional stories and songs from the area on the borders of Scotland and England. He also wrote novels,
    many of which were set in Scotland.
    </span>
</p>
<p>Poetry was very popular in the 19th century, with poets such as William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley,
	Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Later, many poets - for example,
    <span id=564>Wilfred Owen and Siegfried
    Sassoon - were inspired to write about their experiences in the First World War. More recently, popular poets have
    included Sir Walter de la Mare, John Masefield, Sir John Betjeman and Ted Hughes. Some of the best-known poets are
        buried or commemorated in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey.

<p>People in the UK spend their leisure time in many different ways.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_132">Gardening</h3>
<p>
    <span id="853">
    A lot of people have gardens at home and will spend their free time looking after them. Some people rent additional
    land called 'an allotment', where they grow fruit and vegetables. Gardening and flower shows range from major
    national exhibitions to small local events. Many towns have garden centres selling plants and gardening equipment.
    </span>
	There are famous gardens to visit throughout the UK, including Kew Gardens, Sissinghurst and Hidcote in England,
	Crathes Castle and Inveraray Castle in Scotland,
	<span id="71">Bodnant Garden in Wales</span>, and Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_133">Shopping</h3>
<p>There are many different places to go shopping in the UK. Most towns and cities have a central shopping area, which
	is called the town centre. Undercover shopping centres are also common - these might be in town centres or on the
	outskirts of a town or city. Most shops in the UK are open seven days a week, although trading hours on Sundays and
	public holidays are generally reduced. Many towns also have markets on one or more days a week, where stallholders
	sell a variety of goods.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_134">Cooking and food</h3>
<p>Many people in the UK enjoy cooking. They often invite each other to their homes for dinner. A wide variety of food

<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Traditional foods</h4>
<p class="box">There are a variety of foods that are traditionally associated with different parts of the UK:</p>
<p class="box">

</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_135">Films</h3>
<h5 class="sigil_not_in_toc">British film industry</h5>
<p>The UK has had a major influence on modern cinema.</p>
<p>
    <span id="610"><span id="115">
    Films were first shown publicly in the UK in 1896 and film screenings very quickly became popular. From the
    beginning, film makers became famous for clever special effects and this continues to be an area of British
    expertise. From the early days of the cinema, British actors have worked in both the UK and USA.
</span></span>
    <span id="282">
        Sir Charles (Charlie) Chaplin became famous in silent movies for his tramp character and was one of many British actors to make a career in Hollywood.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="634">
    British studios flourished in the 1930s. Eminent directors included Sir Alexander Korda and Sir Alfred Hitchcock, who
    later left for Hollywood and remained an important film director until his death in 1980. During the Second World
    War, British movies (for example, <i>In Which We Serve</i>) played an important part in boosting morale.
		Later, British directors including Sir David Lean and Ridley Scott found great success both in the UK and internationally.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="568">
    The 1950s and 1960s were a high point for British comedies, including <i>Passport to Pimlico</i>, <i>The
	    Ladykillers</i> and, later, the <i>Carry On</i> films.
</span>
</p>
<span id="964">
<p>Many of the films now produced in the UK are made by foreign companies, using British expertise. Some of the most
	commercially successful films of all time, including the two highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and
	James Bond), have been produced in the UK. Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film
	studio facility in the world.
    <span id="863">
        Britain continues to be particularly strong in special effects and animation. One
    example is the work of Nick Park, who has won four Oscars for his animated films, including three for films
    featuring Wallace and Gromit.
    </span>
</p>
</span>
<p>
    <span id="633">
        Actors such as Sir Lawrence Olivier, David Niven, Sir Rex Harrison and Richard Burton starred in a wide variety of
    popular films. British actors continue to be popular and continue to win awards throughout the world. Recent British
    actors to have won Oscars include Colin Firth, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Dame Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Tilda
    Swinton.
    </span>
</p>
<p>The annual British Academy Film Awards, hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), are the
	British equivalent of the Oscars.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_136">British comedy</h3>
<p>
    <span id="203">
    The traditions of comedy and satire, and the ability to laugh at ourselves, are an important part of the UK
    character.
    </span>
	Medieval kings and rich nobles had jesters who told jokes and made fun of people in the Court. Later,
	Shakespeare included comic characters in his plays. In the 18th century, political cartoons attacking prominent
	politicians - and, sometimes, the monarch or other members of the Royal Family - became increasingly popular.
    <span id="730">
    <span id="352">
        In the 19th century, satirical magazines began to be published.
        The most famous was <i>Punch</i>, which was published for the first time in the 1840s.
    </span>
    </span>
	Today, political cartoons continue to be published in newspapers, and magazines such as
	<i>Private Eye</i> continue the tradition of satire.
</p>
<p>Comedians were a popular feature of British music hall, a form of variety theatre which was very common until
	television became the leading form of entertainment in the UK. Some of the people who had performed in the music
	halls in the 1940s and 1950s, such as Morecambe and Wise, became stars of television.</p>
<p>Television comedy developed its own style. Situation comedies, or sitcoms, which often look at family life and
	relationships in the workplace, remain popular. Satire has also continued to be important, with shows like <i>That
		Was The Week That Was</i> in the 1960s and <i>Spitting Image</i> in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1969, <i>Monty
		Python's Flying Circus</i> introduced a new type of progressive comedy. Stand-up comedy, where a solo comedian
	talks to a live audience, has become popular again in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_137">Television and radio</h3>
<p>Many different television (TV) channels are available in the UK. Some are free to watch and others require a paid
	subscription. British television shows a wide variety of programmes.
    <span id="237">
        Popular programmes include regular soap operas such as <i>Coronation Street</i> and <i>EastEnders</i>.
    </span>
	In Scotland, some Scotland-specific programmes are shown and there is also a channel with programmes in the Gaelic
	language. There is a Welsh-language channel in Wales. There are also programmes specific to Northern Ireland and
	some programmes broadcast in Irish Gaelic.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="599"><span id="202"><span id="740"><span id="88"><span id="283">
    Everyone in the UK with a TV, computer or other medium which can be used for watching TV must have a television
    licence. One licence covers all of the equipment in one home, except when people rent different rooms in a shared
    house and each has a separate tenancy agreement - those people must each buy a separate licence.
	  You need to buy a TV Licence if there are no TVs in your house but you watch TV programs on your mobile phone.
    People over 75 can apply for a free TV licence and blind people can get a 50% discount.
	  You will receive a fine of up to £1,000 if you watch TV but do not have a TV licence.
	  </span></span></span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="791"><span id="601"><span id="40">
The money from TV licences is used to pay for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). This is a British public
    service broadcaster providing television and radio programmes. The BBC is the largest broadcaster in the world. It
    is the only wholly state-funded media organisation that is independent of government. Other UK channels are
    primarily funded through advertisements and subscriptions.
</span></span></span>
</p>
<p>There are also many different radio stations in the UK. Some broadcast nationally and others in certain cities or
	regions. There are radio stations that play certain types of music and some broadcast in regional languages such as
	Welsh or Gaelic. Like television, BBC radio stations are funded by TV licences and other radio stations are funded
	through advertisements.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_138">Social networking</h3>
<p>
    <span id="536">
        Social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter are a popular way for people to stay in touch with friends,
    organise social events, and share photos, videos and opinions. Many people use social networking on their mobile
    phones when out and about.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_139">Pubs and night clubs</h3>
<p>
    <span id="820">
        Public houses (pubs) are an important part of the UK social culture. Many people enjoy meeting friends in the pub.
    Most communities will have a 'local' pub that is a natural focal point for social activities. Pub quizzes are
    popular. Pool and darts are traditional pub games.
    </span>
	To buy alcohol in a pub or night club you must be 18 or over, but
	people under that age may be allowed in some pubs with an adult.
    <span id="116">When they are 16, people can drink wine or beer with a meal in a hotel or restaurant
        (including eating areas in pubs) as long as they are with someone over 18.
    </span>
</p>
<span id="41">
<p>Pubs are usually open during the day from 11.00 am (12 noon on Sundays). Night clubs with dancing and music usually
	open and close later than pubs. The licensee decides the hours that the pub or night club is open.</p>
</span>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_140">Betting and gambling</h3>
<p>
    <span id="371">
        In the UK, people often enjoy a gamble on sports or other events. There are also casinos in many places. You have to
    be 18 to go into betting shops or gambling clubs.
    </span>
	There is a National Lottery for which draws are made every week. You can enter by buying a ticket or a scratch card.
    <span id="238">
        People under 16 are not allowed to participate in the National Lottery.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_141">Pets</h3>
<p>
    <span id="844">
        A lot of people in the UK have pets such as cats or dogs. They might have them for company or because they enjoy
    looking after them. It is against the law to treat a pet cruelly or to neglect it. All dogs in public places must
    wear a collar showing the name and address of the owner. The owner is responsible for keeping the dog under control
    and for cleaning up after the animal in a public place.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="142"><span id="586">
        Vaccinations and medical treatment for animals are available from veterinary surgeons (vets). There are charities
    which may help people who cannot afford to pay a vet.
    </span></span>
</p>
<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_142">Places of interest</h2>
<p>
    <span id="307">
        The UK has a large network of public footpaths in the countryside. There are also many opportunities for mountain
    biking, mountaineering and hill walking.
        <span id="543">
            There are 15 national parks in England, Wales and Scotland. They are areas
    of protected countryside that everyone can visit, and where people live, work and look after the landscape.
        </span>
    </span>
</p>
<p>There are many museums in the UK, which range from small community museums to large national and civic collections.
	Famous landmarks exist in towns, cities and the countryside throughout the UK. Most of them are open to the public
	to view (generally for a charge).
</p>
<p>
    <span id="5">
    Many parts of the countryside and places of interest are kept open by the National Trust in England, Wales and
    Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scotland. Both are charities that work to preserve important buildings,
    coastline and countryside in the UK. The National Trust was founded in 1895 by three volunteers.
    <span id="422">
        There are now more than 61,000 volunteers helping to keep the organisation running.
