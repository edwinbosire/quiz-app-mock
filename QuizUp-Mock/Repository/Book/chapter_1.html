	<li>Responsibilities and freedoms of all UK residents</li>

<p>Britain is a fantastic place to live: a modern, thriving society with a long and illustrious history. Our people have
	been at the heart of the world's political, scientific, industrial and cultural development. We are proud of our
	record of welcoming new migrants who will add to the diversity and dynamism of our national life.</p>
<p>Applying to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK is an important decision and commitment. You will be
	agreeing to accept the responsibilities which go with permanent residence and to respect the laws, values and
	traditions of the UK. Good citizens are an asset to the UK. We welcome those seeking to make a positive contribution
	to our society.</p>
<p>Passing the Life in the UK test is part of demonstrating that you are ready to become a permanent migrant to the UK.
	This handbook is designed to support you in your preparation. It will help you to integrate into society and play a
	full role in your local community. It will also help ensure that you have a broad general knowledge of the
	culture, laws and history of the UK.</p>
<h2>The values and principles of the UK</h2>
<p>British society is founded on fundamental values and principles which all those living in the UK should respect and
	support. These values are reflected in the responsibilities, rights and privileges of being a British citizen or
	permanent resident of the UK.
	<span id="529">They are based on history and traditions and are protected by law, customs and
		expectations. There is no place in British society for extremism or intolerance.
	</span>
</p>
<span id="625">
	<span id="49">
		<div>The fundamental principles of British life include:</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Democracy</li>
				<li>The rule of law</li>
				<li>Individual liberty</li>
				<li>Tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs</li>
				<li>Participation in community life.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</span>
</span>
<p>As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to uphold these values. The pledge is:</p>
<p class="quote">'I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its
	democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British
	citizen.'</p>
<p>Flowing from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and freedoms which are shared by all those living in the
	UK and which we expect all residents to respect.</p>
<span id="122">
	<ul>
		<li>If you wish to be a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you should:</li>
		<li>Respect and obey the law</li>
		<li>Respect the rights of others, including their right to their own opinions</li>
		<li>Treat others with fairness</li>
		<li>Look after yourself and your family</li>
		<li>Look after the area in which you live and the environment.</li>
	</ul>
</span>
<div>In return, the UK offers:</div>
<span id="73">
	<ul>
		<li>Freedom of belief and religion</li>
		<li>Freedom of speech</li>
		<li>Freedom from unfair discrimination</li>
		<li>A right to a fair trial</li>
		<li>A right to join in the election of a government.</li>
	</ul>
</span>
<h2>Becoming a permanent resident</h2>
<p>To apply to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you will need to:</p>
<span id="746">
	<ul>
		<li>Speak and read English</li>
		<li>Have a good understanding of life in the UK.</li>
	</ul>
</span>
<p>There are currently (as of January 2013) two ways you can be tested on these requirements:</p>
<span id="26">
	<ul>
		<li>Take the Life in the UK test. The questions are written in a way that requires an understanding of the English
			language at English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Entry Level 3, so there is no need to take a separate
			English language test. People here on work visas, including those on Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the points based
			system, normally must pass the Life in the UK test to become permanent residents.
		</li>
		<li>Pass an ESOL course in English with Citizenship. You will need to take this course if your standard of English
			is below ESOL Entry Level 3. The course will help you to improve your English and learn more about life in the
			UK. At the end of the course you will take a test.
		</li>
	</ul>
</span>
<p>Once you have passed one of these tests, you can make an application for permanent residence or British citizenship.
	The form that you have to complete and the evidence that you need to provide will depend on your personal
	circumstances. There is a fee for submitting an application, which is different for the various types of
	application. All of the forms and a list of fees can be found on the UK Border Agency website, <a
		href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/">www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. From October 2013, the
	requirements will change. From that date, for settlement or permanent residence, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pass the Life in the UK test</li>
</ul>
<div><i><b>AND</b></i></div>
<ul>
	<li>Produce acceptable evidence of speaking and listening skills in English at B1 of the Common European Framework
		of Reference. This is equivalent to ESOL Entry Level 3.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements for citizenship applications may also change in the future. Further details will be published on the
	UK Border Agency website and you should check the information on that website for current requirements before
	applying for settlement or citizenship.</p>
<h2>Taking the Life in the UK test</h2>
<p>This handbook will help prepare you for taking the Life in the UK test. The test consists of 24 questions about important aspects
	of life in the UK. Questions are based on ALL parts of the handbook. The 24 questions will be different for each
	person taking the test at that test session.</p>
<p>

		in Welsh or Scottish Gaelic.
	</span>
