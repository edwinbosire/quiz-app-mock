<h1 id="sigil_toc_id_28">Chapter 3: A long and illustrious history</h1>
<p>In this chapter you will learn about British history starting from the Stone Age. The beginning focuses on arriving
	populations which affected the language and religions of Britain. After that the focus is on the development of the
	Monarchy, church and Parliament. Major battles and significant periods are covered, including the civil war, the
	industrial revolution and the Empire. There is a lot of information about WWI and WWII and after WWII the chapter
	focuses on the governments of the UK and devolution in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.</p>
<p>Make sure that you understand the relationship between the monarchy and Parliament, Protestants and Catholics and
	Britain and the colonies of the Empire. Think about how the right to vote developed. You should also make sure you
	know about each of the people described. You will need to know about the Acts of Parliament and other major events.
	You should make sure that you know all of the dates given in this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_29">Early Britain</h2>
<p><span id="169">
    The first people to live in Britain were hunter-gatherers, in what we call the Stone Age.
</span>
	For much of the Stone Age, Britain was connected to the continent by a land bridge. People came and went, following
	the herds of deer and horses which they hunted.
    <span id="217">
        Britain only became permanently separated from the continent by the Channel about 10,000 years ago.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="774"><span id="242">
    The first farmers arrived in Britain about 6,000 years ago.
</span></span>
    <span id="75"><span id="51">
        The ancestors of these first farmers probably came from south-east Europe. These people built houses, tombs and monuments on the land.
    </span></span>
    <span id="289">
        One of these monuments, Stonehenge, still stands in what is now the English county of Wiltshire.
    </span>
    <span id="816">
        Stonehenge was probably a special gathering place for seasonal ceremonies. Other Stone Age sites have also survived.
    </span>
    <span id="632"><span id="481">
        Skara Brae on Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland, is the best preserved prehistoric village in northern Europe,
        and has helped archaeologists to understand more about how people lived near the end of the Stone Age.
    </span></span>
</p>
<span id="27">
    <p>Around 4,000 years ago, people learned to make bronze. We call this period the Bronze Age.</p>
</span>
<p>
    <span id="28"><span id="478">People lived in roundhouses and buried their dead in tombs called round barrows.
        <span id="290"><span id="581">The people of the Bronze Age were accomplished metalworkers who made many beautiful objects in bronze and gold, including tools, ornaments and weapons.</span></span>
        </span>
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="777"><span id="582">
        The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age, when people learned how to make weapons and tools out of iron. People still lived
    in roundhouses, grouped together into larger settlements, and sometimes defended sites called hill forts.
    </span></span>
    <span id="338"><span id="482">
        A very impressive hill fort can still be seen today at Maiden Castle, in the English county of Dorset.
    </span></span>
	Most people were farmers, craft workers or warriors.
    <span id="52">
        The language they spoke was part of the Celtic language family. Similar languages were spoken across Europe in
        the Iron Age, and related languages are still spoken today in some parts of Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
    </span>
    <span id="649"><span id="99">
        The people of the Iron Age had a sophisticated culture and economy. They made the first coins to be
        minted in Britain
    </span>, some inscribed with the names of Iron Age kings. This marks the beginnings of British history.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_30">The Romans</h3>
<p><span id="531"><span id="243">
    Julius Caesar led a Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC. This was unsuccessful and for nearly 100 years Britain
    remained separate from the Roman Empire. In AD 43 the Emperor Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion. This
    time, there was resistance from some of the British tribes but the Romans were successful in occupying almost all of
    Britain.
</span></span>
    <span id="532"><span id="218">
        One of the tribal leaders who fought against the Romans was Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni in what is now
    eastern England. She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on Westminster Bridge in London, near the Houses of Parliament.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="460">Areas of what is now Scotland were never conquered by the Romans, and the
    <span id="219">
        Emperor Hadrian built a wall in the north of England to keep out the Picts (ancestors of the Scottish people).
        Included in the wall were a number of forts.
    </span>
</span>
    <span id="952">
    Parts of Hadrian's Wall, including the forts of Housesteads and Vindolanda, can still be seen. It is a popular area
    for walkers and is a UNESCO (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage
    Site.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="29"><span id="124"><span id="485">
The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and introduced new plants and animals.
</span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span id=4"><span id=386">
    It was during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD that the first Christian communities began to appear in Britain.
</span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_31">The Anglo-Saxons</h3>
<p><span id="53"><span id="244"><span id="434">
    The Roman army left Britain in AD 410 to defend other parts of the Roman Empire and never returned. Britain was again
    invaded by tribes from northern Europe: the Jutes, the Angles and the Saxons.
</span></span>
    The languages they spoke are the basis of modern-day English.
</span>
    <span id="339"><span id="483">
        Battles were fought against these invaders but, by about AD 600, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were established in Britain.
        These kingdoms were mainly in what is now England.
    </span></span>
    <span id="748"><span id="100"><span id="484">
        The burial place of one of the kings was at Sutton Hoo in modern Suffolk. This king was buried with treasure and armour,
        all placed in a ship which was then covered by a mound of earth.
    </span></span></span>
    <span id="771"><span id="459">
        Parts of the west of Britain, including much of what is now Wales, and Scotland, remained free of Anglo-Saxon rule.
    </span></span>
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span id="721">
    The Anglo-Saxons were not Christians when they first came to Britain but, during this period, missionaries came to
    Britain to preach about Christianity. Missionaries from Ireland spread the religion in the north. The most famous of
    these were St Patrick, who would become the patron saint of Ireland (see patron saints), and St Columba, who founded
    a monastery on the island of Iona, off the coast of what is now Scotland.
    <span id="802">
        St Augustine led missionaries from Rome, who spread Christianity in the south. St Augustine became the first
        Archbishop of Canterbury (see the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church in Britain today).
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_32">The Vikings</h3>
<span id="54">
<span id="170"><span id="330"><p>
	The Vikings came from Denmark and Norway. They first visited Britain in AD 789 to raid coastal towns and take away
	goods and slaves. Then, they began to stay and form their own communities in the east of England and Scotland. The
	Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under King Alfred the Great, who defeated the Vikings.
</p>
</span></span>
    <span id="266"><span id="76"><span id="435">
        Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain - especially in the east and north of England, in an area known as the Danelaw (many
    places names there, such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe, come from the Viking languages).
    </span></span>
        The Viking settlers mixed with local communities and some converted to Christianity.
    </span>
</span>
<p><span id="722"><span id="125">
    Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England, except for a short period when there were Danish kings.
    The first of these was Cnut, also called Canute.
</span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="332">
    In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged the people to unite under one king, Kenneth MacAlpin.
    The term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_33">The Norman Conquest</h3>
<p><span id="674"><span id="220"><span id="489">
    In 1066, an invasion led by William, the Duke of Normandy (in what is now northern France), defeated Harold, the
    Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. Harold was killed in the battle. William became king of England
    and is known as William the Conqueror.
</span></span></span>
    <span id="148"><span id="340"><span id="391">
        The battle is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known as the
        Bayeux Tapestry, which is 70 meters long and can still be seen in France today.
    </span></span></span>
</p>
<p><span id="291">
    The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England and led to many changes in government and
    social structures in England. Norman French, the language of the new ruling class, influenced the development of the
    English language as we know it today.
</span>
	Initially the Normans also conquered Wales, but the Welsh gradually won territory back. The Scots and the Normans
	fought on the border between England and Scotland; the Normans took over some land on the border but did not invade Scotland.
</p>
<p><span id="758"><span id="245"><span id="436">
    William sent people all over England to draw up lists of all the towns and villages. The people who lived there, who
    owned the land and what animals they owned were also listed. This was called the Domesday Book. It still exists
    today and gives a picture of society in England just after the Norman Conquest.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_35">The Middle Ages</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_36">War at home and abroad</h3>
<p><span id="126"><span id="387">
    The period after the Norman Conquest up until about 1485 is called the Middle Ages (or the medieval period). It was a
    time of almost constant war.
</span></span>
</p>
<p>The English kings fought with the Welsh, Scottish and Irish noblemen for control of their lands. In Wales, the
	English were able to establish their rule.
    <span id="440">
        In 1284 King Edward I of England introduced the Statute of Rhuddlan, which annexed Wales to the Crown of England.
        Huge castles, including Conwy and Caernarvon, were built to maintain this power.
    </span>
    <span id="292"><span id="580">
        By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been defeated. English laws and the English language were introduced.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="650"><span id="246"><span id="486">
    In Scotland, the English kings were less successful. In 1314 the Scottish, led by Robert the Bruce, defeated the
    English at the Battle of Bannockburn, and Scotland remained unconquered by the English.
    </span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="629"><span id="341">At the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland was an independent country.
        The English first went to Ireland as troops to help the Irish king and remained to build their own settlements.
        By 1200, the English ruled an area of Ireland known as the Pale, around Dublin.</span>
    </span>
	Some of the important lords in other parts of Ireland accepted the authority of the English king.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="723"><span id="654">
        During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad. Many knights took part in the
        Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the Holy Land. English kings also fought a long war
        with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years).
    </span></span>
    <span id="806">
        One of the most famous battles of the Hundred Years War was the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, where King Henry V's
        vastly outnumbered English army defeated the French. The English left France in the 1450s.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_37">The Black Death</h3>
<p>
    <span id="810">
        The Normans used a system of land ownership known as feudalism. The king gave land to his lords in return for help in
    war. Landowners had to send certain numbers of men to serve in the army. Some peasants had their own land but most
    were serfs.
    </span>
</p>
<p>They had a small area of their lord's land where they could grow food. In return, they had to work for their lord and
	could not move away. The same system developed in southern Scotland. In the north of Scotland and Ireland, land was
	owned by members of the 'clans' (prominent families).
</p>
<span id="55">
<span id="329"><span id="409">
	<p>
		In 1348, a disease, probably a form of plague, came to Britain. This was known as the Black Death. One third of the
		population of England died and a similar proportion in Scotland and Wales. This was one of the worst disasters ever
		to strike Britain.
	</p>
</span></span>
    <span id="631">
        <span id="577">
	        <p>
		        Following the Black Death, the smaller population meant there was less need to grow cereal crops.
		        There were labour shortages and peasants began to demand higher wages. New social classes appeared, including owners
		        of large areas of land (later called the gentry), and people left the countryside to live in the towns. In the
		        towns, growing wealth led to the development of a strong middle class.
	        </p>
        </span>
    </span>
</span>
<div>In Ireland, the Black Death killed many in the Pale and, for a time, the area controlled by the English became
	smaller.
</div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_38">Legal and political changes</h3>
<p><span id="528"><span id="121">In the Middle Ages, Parliament began to develop into the institution it is today. Its origins can be traced to the
    king's council of advisers, which included important noblemen and the leaders of the Church.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="773"><span id="221">
    There were few formal limits to the king's power until 1215. In that year, King John was forced by his noblemen to
    agree to a number of demands. The result was a charter of rights called the Magna Carta (which means the Great
    Charter).
</span></span>
    <span id="247">
        The Magna Carta established the idea that even the king was subject to the law. It protected the rights of
    the nobility and restricted the king's power to collect taxes or to make or change laws. In future, the king would
    need to involve his noblemen in decisions.
    </span>
</p>
<p>In England, parliaments were called for the king to consult his nobles, particularly when the king needed to raise
	money. The numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts, known as Houses, were established.
    <span id="77">
        The nobility, great landowners and bishops sat in the House of Lords.
    </span>
    <span id="342">
        Knights, who were usually smaller landowners, and wealthy people from towns and cities were elected to sit in
        the House of Commons.
    </span>
	Only a small part of the population was able to join in electing the members of the Commons.
</p>
<p>A similar Parliament developed in Scotland.
    <span id="149">
        It had three Houses, called Estates: the lords, the commons and the clergy.
    </span>
</p>
<p>This was also a time of development in the legal system. The principle that judges are independent of the government
	began to be established.
    <span id="527"><span id="328">
        In England, judges developed 'common law' by a process of precedence (that is, following previous decisions) and tradition.
    </span></span>
	In Scotland, the legal system developed slightly differently and laws were
	'codified' (that is, written down).
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_39">A distinct identity</h3>
<p>The Middle Ages saw the development of a national culture and identity.
    <span id="808"><span id="103">
        After the Norman Conquest, the king and his noblemen had spoken Norman French and the peasants had continued to speak Anglo-Saxon.
        Gradually these two languages combined to become one English language.
    </span></span>
    <span id="293">
        Some words in modern English - for example, 'park' and 'beauty' - are based on Norman French words.
    </span>
	Others - for example, 'apple', 'cow' and 'summer' - are based on Anglo-Saxon words. In
	modern English there are often words with very similar meanings, one from French and one from Anglo-Saxon. 'Demand'
	(French) and 'ask' (Anglo-Saxon) are examples.
    <span id="127">By 1400, in England, official documents were being written in
        English, and English had become the preferred language of the royal court and Parliament.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="724">
        In the years leading up to 1400, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a series of poems in English about a group of people going to Canterbury on a pilgrimage.
        <span id="222">The people decided to tell each other stories on the journey, and the poems describe the
        travellers and some of the stories they told. This collection of poems is called The Canterbury Tales.
        </span>
    </span>
	It was one of the first books to be printed by William Caxton, the first person in England to print books using a printing press.
	Many of the stories are still popular. Some have been made into plays and television programmes.</p>
<p>In Scotland, many people continued to speak Gaelic and the Scots language also developed. A number of poets began to
	write in the Scots language. One example is
	<span id="171">John Barbour, who wrote The Bruce about the Battle of Bannockburn</span>.
</p>
<p>The Middle Ages also saw a change in the type of buildings in Britain.
    <span id="248">Castles were built in many places in Britain
    and Ireland, partly for defence. Today many are in ruins, although some, such as Windsor and Edinburgh, are still in
    use.</span>
    <span id="461">Great cathedrals - for example, Lincoln Cathedral - were also built, and many of these are still used for
    worship.</span>
    <span id="294">Several of the cathedrals had windows of stained glass, telling stories about the Bible and Christian
        saints. The glass in York Minster is a famous example.
    </span>
</p>
<span id="56">
<span id="249">During this period, England was an important trading nation.
    <span id="326">
	    <p>English wool became a very important export. People came to England from abroad to trade and also to work.</p></span>
	<p>
		Many had special skills, such as weavers from France, engineers from Germany, glass manufacturers from Italy and canal builders from Holland.
	</p>
</span>

</span>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_40">The Wars of the Roses</h3>
<p><span id="677">In 1455, a civil war was begun to decide who should be king of England. It was fought between the supporters of two
    families: the House of Lancaster and the House of York. This war was called the Wars of the Roses, because the
    symbol of Lancaster was a red rose and the symbol of York was a white rose.
</span>
    <span id="128">
        The war ended with the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. King Richard III of the House of York was
        killed in the battle and Henry Tudor, the leader of the House of Lancaster, became King Henry VII.
    </span>
	Henry then married King Richard's niece, Elizabeth of York, and united the two families.
	Henry was the first king of the House of Tudor.
    <span id="651"><span id="343">
        The symbol of the House of Tudor was a red rose with a white rose inside it as a sign that the Houses of York and Lancaster were now allies.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_42">The Tudors and Stuarts</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_43">Religious conflicts</h3>
<p>After his victory in the Wars of the Roses, <span id="78">Henry VII wanted to make sure that England remained peaceful and that his
    position as king was secure. He deliberately strengthened the central administration of England and reduced the
    power of the nobles. He was thrifty and built up the monarchy's financial reserves.
</span> When he died, his son Henry VIII continued the policy of centralising power.
</p>
<p>Henry VIII was most famous for breaking away from the Church of Rome and marrying six times.</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">The six wives of Henry VIII</h4>
<span id="829">3 of the wives were called Catherine and 2 were called Anne.</span>
<p class="box">
    <span id="778">
        <b>Catherine of Aragon</b> - Catherine was a Spanish princess. She and Henry had a number of children but
    only one, Mary, survived. When Catherine was too old to give him another child, Henry decided to divorce her, hoping
    that another wife would give him a son to be his heir.
    </span>
</p>
<p class="box">
    <span id="675"><b>Anne Boleyn</b> - <span id="223">Anne Boleyn was English.
    <span id="410">
        She and Henry had one daughter, Elizabeth.
    </span>
    Anne was unpopular in the country and was accused of taking lovers. She was executed at the Tower of London.
    </span>
    </span>
</p>
<p class="box"><b>Jane Seymour</b> - Henry married Jane after Anne's execution. She gave Henry the son he wanted,
	Edward, but she died shortly after the birth.
</p>
<p class="box">
    <span id="627">
        <b>Anne of Cleves</b> - Anne was a German princess. Henry married her for political reasons but divorced her soon after.
    </span>
</p>
<p class="box"><b>Catherine Howard</b> -
	<span id="367">Catherine was a cousin of Anne Boleyn. She was also accused of taking lovers and executed.</span>
</p>
<p class="box"><b>Catherine Parr</b> - Catherine was a widow who married Henry late in his life. She survived him and
	married again but died soon after.
</p>
<p><span id="700"><span id="104">
    To divorce his first wife, Henry needed the approval of the Pope. When the Pope refused, Henry established the Church
    of England. In this new Church, the king, not the Pope, would have the power to appoint bishops and order how people
    should worship.
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p><span id="755">
    At the same time the Reformation was happening across Europe.
    <span id="908">
        This was a movement against the authority of the Pope
    and the ideas and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. The Protestants formed their own churches. They read the
    Bible in their own languages instead of in Latin; they did not pray to saints or at shrines; and they believed that
    a person's own relationship with God was more important than submitting to the authority of the Church.
    </span>
</span>
    <span id="250">
        Protestant ideas gradually gained strength in England, Wales and Scotland during the 16th century.
    </span>
</p>
<p>In Ireland, however, attempts by the English to impose Protestantism (alongside efforts to introduce the English
	system of laws about the inheritance of land) led to rebellion from the Irish chieftains, and much brutal fighting
	followed.</p>
<p>During the reign of Henry VIII, Wales became formally united with England by the Act for the Government of Wales. The
	Welsh sent representatives to the House of Commons and the Welsh legal system was reformed.</p>
<p><span id="129"><span id="583">
    Henry VIII was succeeded by his son Edward VI, who was strongly Protestant. During his reign, the Book of Common
    Prayer was written to be used in the Church of England.
</span>
</span>
	A version of this book is still used in some churches today. Edward died at the age of 15 after ruling for just over six years, and his half-sister Mary became queen.
    <span id="725"><span id="145">
        Mary was a devout Catholic and persecuted Protestants (for this reason, she became known as 'Bloody Mary')
    </span>.
        Mary also died after a short reign and the next monarch was her half-sister, Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_44">Queen Elizabeth I</h3>
<p><span id="795">
    Queen Elizabeth I was a Protestant. She re-established the Church of England as the official Church in England.
    Everyone had to attend their local church and there were laws about the type of religious services and the prayers
    which could be said, but Elizabeth did not ask about people's real beliefs. She succeeded in finding a balance
    between the views of Catholics and the more extreme Protestants. In this way, she avoided any serious religious
    conflict within England.
</span>
    <span id="57"><span id="457"><span id="172"><span id="267">
        Elizabeth became one of the most popular monarchs in English history, particularly after
        1588, when the English defeated the Spanish Armada (a large fleet of ships), which had been sent by Spain to conquer
        England and restore Catholicism.
    </span></span></span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_45">The Reformation in Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>
<p>Scotland had also been strongly influenced by Protestant ideas.
    <span id="216">
        In 1560, the predominantly Protestant Scottish
    Parliament abolished the authority of the Pope in Scotland and Roman Catholic religious services became illegal.
    </span>
	A Protestant Church of Scotland with an leadership was established but, unlike in England, this was not a state
	Church.
</p>
<p><span id="602">
    The queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart (often now called 'Mary, Queen of Scots') was a Catholic. She was only a week old
    when her father died and she became queen. Much of her childhood was spent in France. When she returned to Scotland,
    she was the centre of a power struggle between different groups.
    When her husband was murdered, Mary was suspected of involvement and fled to England. She gave her throne to her
    Protestant son, James VI of Scotland.
    </span>
    <span id="251">
        Mary was Elizabeth I's cousin and hoped that Elizabeth might help her, but Elizabeth suspected Mary of wanting to take over
    the English throne, and kept her a prisoner for 20 years. Mary was eventually executed, accused of plotting against Elizabeth I.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_46">Exploration, poetry and drama</h3>
<p><span id="770"><span id="295">
    The Elizabethan period in England was a time of growing patriotism: a feeling of pride in being English. English
    explorers sought new trade routes and tried to expand British trade into the Spanish colonies in the Americas.
</span></span>
    <span id="58">
        Sir Francis Drake, one of the commanders in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, was one of the founders of England's naval tradition.</span>
	His ship, <span id="442">the Golden Hind, was one of the first to sail right around ('circumnavigate') the world.
    </span>
    <span id="630">
        In Elizabeth I's time, English settlers first began to colonise the eastern coast of America. This colonisation,
    particularly by people who disagreed with the religious views of the next two kings, greatly increased in the next century.
    </span>
</p>
<p>The Elizabethan period is also remembered for the richness of its poetry and drama, especially the plays and poems of William Shakespeare.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">William Shakespeare (1564-1616)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="252">
    Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.
    </span>
    <span id="949">
    He was a playwright and actor and wrote many poems and plays. His most famous plays include
    <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Macbeth</i> and
    <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. He also dramatised significant events from the past, but he did not focus solely on kings and
    queens. He was one of the first to portray ordinary Englishmen and women.
    </span>
    <span id="701">
        Shakespeare had a great influence on the English language and invented many words that are still common today.
    </span>
</p>
<span id="841">
	Lines from his plays and poems which are often still quoted include:
    <ul>
	    <li class="box">Once more unto the breach (<i>Henry V</i>)</li>
	    <li class="box">To be or not to be (<i>Hamlet</i>)</li>
	    <li class="box">A rose by any other name (<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>)</li>
	    <li class="box">All the world's a stage (<i>As You Like It</i>)</li>
	    <li class="box">The darling buds of May (<i>Sonnet 18 - Shall I Compare Thee To a Summer's Day</i>).</li>
    </ul>
</span>
<p class="box">Many people regard Shakespeare as the greatest playwright of all time. His plays and poems are still
	performed and studied in Britain and other countries today. The Globe Theatre in London is a modern copy of the
	theatres in which his plays were first performed.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_47">James VI and I</h3>
<p>
    <span id="818">
        Elizabeth I never married and so had no children of her own to inherit her throne. When she died in 1603 her heir was
    her cousin James VI of Scotland. He became King James I of England, Wales and Ireland but Scotland remained a
    separate country.
    </span>
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">The King James Bible</h4>
<p class="box"><span id="415"><span id="173">
    One achievement of King James' reign was a new translation of the Bible into English. This translation is
    known as the 'King James Version' or the 'Authorised Version'.
</span></span>
	It was not the first English Bible but is a version which continues to be used in many Protestant churches today.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_48">Ireland</h3>
<p>During this period, Ireland was an almost completely Catholic country. Henry VII and Henry VIII had extended English
	control outside the Pale (see War at Home and Abroad) and had established English authority over the whole country.
    <span id="443">
        Henry VIII took the title 'King of Ireland'. English laws were introduced and local leaders were expected to follow
        the instructions of the Lord Lieutenants in Dublin.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="811"><span id="726">
    During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, many people in Ireland opposed rule by the Protestant government in
    England. There were a number of rebellions. The English government encouraged Scottish and English Protestants to
    settle in Ulster, the northern province of Ireland, taking over the land from Catholic landholders. These
    settlements were known as plantations.
    </span></span>
	Many of the new settlers came from south-west Scotland and other land was
	given to companies based in London. James later organised similar plantations in several other parts of Ireland.
	This had serious long term consequences for the history of England, Scotland and Ireland.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_49">The rise of Parliament</h3>
<p>Elizabeth I was very skilled at managing Parliament. During her reign, she was successful in balancing her wishes and
	views against those of the House of Lords and those of the House of Commons, which was increasingly Protestant in
	its views.</p>
<p><span id="225"><span id="445">
    James I and his son Charles I were less skilled politically. Both believed in the 'Divine Right of Kings': the idea
    that the king was directly appointed by God to rule. They thought that the king should be able to act without having
    to seek approval from Parliament.
</span></span>
	When Charles I inherited the thrones of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, he
	tried to rule in line with this principle. When he could not get Parliament to agree with his religious and foreign
	policies, he tried to rule without Parliament at all.
    <span id="444">For 11 years, he found ways in which to raise money without
    Parliament's approval but eventually trouble in Scotland meant that he had to recall Parliament.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_50">The beginning of the English civil war</h3>
<p><span id="831">
    Charles I wanted the worship of the Church of England to include more ceremony and introduced a revised Prayer Book.
    He tried to impose this Prayer Book on the Presbyterian Church in Scotland and this led to serious unrest. A
    Scottish army was formed and Charles could not find the money he needed for his own army without the help of
    Parliament.
    In 1640, he recalled Parliament to ask it for funds. </span>
	Many in Parliament were <span id="446">Puritans, a group of
    Protestants who advocated strict and simple religious doctrine and worship. They did not agree with the king's
        religious views and disliked his reforms of the Church of England.
    </span>
	Parliament refused to give the king the money he asked for, even after the Scottish army invaded England.
</p>
<p>Another rebellion began in Ireland because the Roman Catholics in Ireland were afraid of the growing power of the
	Puritans. Parliament took this opportunity to demand control of the English army - a change that would have
	transferred substantial power from the king to Parliament. In response,
    <span id="727"><span id="215">
        Charles I entered the House of Commons and tried to arrest five parliamentary leaders, but they had been warned and were not there.
    </span></span>
	(No monarch has set foot in the Commons since.)
    <span id="368"><span id="174">
        Civil war between the king and Parliament could not now be avoided and began in 1642.
    </span></span>
    <span id="325"><span id="437">
        The country split into those who supported the king (the Cavaliers) and those who supported Parliament (the Roundheads).
    </span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_51">Oliver Cromwell and the English Republic</h3>
<p><span id="678">
    The king's army was defeated at the Battles of Marston Moor and Naseby. By 1646, it was clear that Parliament had won the war.
    <span id="344">
        Charles was held prisoner by the parliamentary army. He was still unwilling to reach any agreement with
        Parliament and in 1649 he was executed.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>England declared itself a republic, called the Commonwealth. It no longer had a monarch. For a time, it was not
	totally clear how the country would be governed. For now, the army was in control. One of its generals, Oliver
	Cromwell, was sent to Ireland, where the revolt which had begun in 1641 still continued and where there was still a
	Royalist army.
	<span id="253">Cromwell was successful in establishing the authority of the English Parliament but did this with
        such violence that even today Cromwell remains a controversial figure in Ireland.
	</span>
</p>
<p>The Scots had not agreed to the execution of Charles I and declared his son Charles II to be king. He was crowned
	king of Scotland and led a Scottish army into England. Cromwell defeated this army in the Battles of Dunbar and
	Worcester.
	<span id="150">Charles II escaped from Worcester, famously hiding in an oak tree on one occasion, and eventually fled to
        Europe. Parliament now controlled Scotland as well as England and Wales.
	</span>
</p>
<p><span id="416"><span id="488">
	After his campaign in Ireland and victory over Charles II at Worcester, Cromwell was recognised as the leader of the
    new republic. He was given the title of Lord Protector and ruled until his death in 1658.
</span></span>
	When Cromwell died, his son, Richard, became Lord Protector in his place but was not able to control the army or the government. Although
	<span id="79">Britain had been a republic for 11 years</span>, without Oliver Cromwell there was no clear leader or system of government.
	Many people in the country wanted stability. People began to talk about the need for a king.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_52">The Restoration</h3>
<p><span id="793"><span id="673">
    In May 1660, Parliament invited Charles II to come back from exile in the Netherlands. He was crowned King Charles II
    of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Charles II made it clear that he had 'no wish to go on his travels again'.
    He understood that he could not always do as he wished but would sometimes need to reach agreement with Parliament.
    Generally, Parliament supported his policies. The Church of England again became the established official Church.
    Both Roman Catholics and Puritans were kept out of power.
</span></span>
</p>
<span id="59">
    <span id="805"><p>
	    During Charles II's reign, in 1665, there was a major outbreak of plague in London. Thousands of people died,
	    especially in poorer areas. The following year, a great fire destroyed much of the city, including many churches and
	    St Paul's Cathedral. London was rebuilt with a new St Paul's, which was designed by a famous architect, Sir
	    Christopher Wren. Samuel Pepys wrote about these events in a diary which was later published and is still read today.</p>
    </span>
</span>
<p>
    <span id="679">
        <span id="105">
            The Habeas Corpus Act became law in 1679. This was a very important piece of legislation which remains relevant today.
        </span>
        Habeas corpus is Latin for 'you must present the person in court'. The Act guaranteed that no one could be
        held prisoner unlawfully. Every prisoner has a right to a court hearing.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="514">
    Charles II was interested in science. During his reign, the Royal Society was formed to promote 'natural knowledge'.
    This is the oldest surviving scientific society in the world. Among its early members were Sir Edmund Halley, who
    successfully predicted the return of the comet now called Halley's Comet, and Sir Isaac Newton.
</span>
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Isaac Newton (1643-1727)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="411"><span id="269">
        Born in Lincolnshire, eastern England, Isaac Newton first became interested in science when he studied at Cambridge University.
    </span></span>
    <span id="804">
    He became an important figure in the field. His most famous published work was <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>
    ('Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'), which showed how gravity
    applied to the whole universe. Newton also discovered that white light is made up of the colours of the rainbow.
    Many of his discoveries are still important for modern science.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_53">A Catholic King</h3>
<p>Charles II had no legitimate children. He died in 1685 and his brother, James, who was a Roman Catholic, became King
	James II in England, Wales and Ireland and King James VII of Scotland. James favoured Roman Catholics and allowed
	them to be army Officers, which an Act of Parliament had forbidden. He did not seek to reach agreements with
	Parliament and arrested some of the bishops of the Church of England. People in England worried that James wanted to
	make England a Catholic country once more. However, his heirs were his two daughters, who were both firmly
	Protestant, and people thought that this meant there would soon be a Protestant monarch again. Then, James's wife
	had a son. Suddenly, it seemed likely that the next monarch would not be a Protestant after all.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_54">The Glorious Revolution</h3>
<p><span id="833">
    James II's elder daughter, Mary, was married to her cousin William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the
    Netherlands.
    <span id="447"><span id="151">
        In 1688, important Protestants in England asked William to invade England and proclaim himself king.
        When William reached England, there was no resistance.
    </span></span>
</span>
	James fled to France and William took over the throne, becoming William III in England, Wales and Ireland, and
	William II of Scotland. William ruled jointly with Mary.
    <span id="369">
        This event was later called the 'Glorious Revolution' <span id="175">because there was no fighting in England and because it
        guaranteed the power of Parliament, ending the threat of a monarch ruling on his or her own as he or she wished.
    </span></span>
	James II wanted to regain the throne and invaded Ireland with the help of a French army.
    <span id="226">William defeated James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, an event which is still
        celebrated by some in Northern Ireland today.
    </span>
	William re-conquered Ireland and James fled back to France. Many restrictions were placed on the Roman Catholic
	Church in Ireland and Irish Catholics were unable to take part in the government.
</p>
<p>There was also support for James in Scotland. An attempt at an armed rebellion in support of James was quickly
	defeated at Killiecrankie.
    <span id="702"><span id="152">
        All Scottish clans were required formally to accept William as king by taking an oath.
        The MacDonalds of Glencoe were late in taking the oath and were all killed.
    </span></span>
	The memory of this massacre meant some Scots distrusted the new government.
</p>
<p><span id="479">
    Some continued to believe that James was the rightful king, particularly in Scotland. Some joined him in exile in
    France; others were secret supporters. James' supporters became known as Jacobites.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_56">A global power</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_57">Constitutional monarchy - The Bill of Rights</h3>
<p>At the coronation of William and Mary, a Declaration of Rights was read. This confirmed that the king would no longer
	be able to raise taxes or administer justice without agreement from Parliament. The balance of power between monarch
	and Parliament had now permanently changed.
    <span id="653">
    <span id="48"><span id="392">
        The Bill of Rights, 1689, confirmed the rights of Parliament and the limits of the king's power.
    </span></span>
    Parliament took control of who could be monarch and declared that the king or queen must
    be a Protestant. A new Parliament had to be elected at least every three years (later this became seven years and
    now it is five years). Every year the monarch had to ask Parliament to renew funding for the army and the navy.
    </span>
</p>
<p>These changes meant that, to be able to govern effectively, the monarch needed to have advisers, or ministers, who
	would be able to ensure a majority of votes in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. There were two main
	groups in Parliament, known as the Whigs and the Tories.
    <span id="822">
        The modern Conservative Party is still sometimes referred
    </span> to as the Tories. This was the beginning of party politics.
</p>
<p><span id="254">
    This was also an important time for the development of a free press (newspapers and other publications which are not controlled by the government).
    <span id="714">
        From 1695, newspapers were allowed to operate without a government licence. Increasing numbers of newspapers began to be published.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p><span id="60">
    The laws passed after the Glorious Revolution are the beginning of what is called 'constitutional monarchy'. The
    monarch remained very important but was no longer able to insist on particular policies or actions if Parliament did
    not agree. After William III, the ministers gradually became more important than the monarch but this was not a
    democracy in the modern sense.
    </span>
	The number of people who had the right to vote for members of Parliament was still
	very small. Only men who owned property of a certain value were able to vote. No women at all had the vote.
    <span id="448">Some constituencies were controlled by a single wealthy family. These were called 'pocket boroughs'.
        Other constituencies had hardly any voters and were called 'rotten boroughs'.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_58">A growing population</h3>
<p><span id="438">This was a time when many people left Britain and Ireland to settle in new colonies in America and elsewhere, but
    others came to live in Britain. The first Jews to come to Britain since the Middle Ages settled in London in 1656.
</span>
    <span id="227">Between 1680 and 1720 many refugees called Huguenots came from France. They were Protestants and had been persecuted
        for their religion.
    </span>
	Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in banking, or in weaving or other crafts.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_59">The Act of Treaty or Union in Scotland</h3>
<p>William and Mary's successor, Queen Anne, had no surviving children. This created uncertainty over the succession in
	England, Wales and Ireland and in Scotland.
    <span id="214"><span id="458">
        The Act of Union, known as the Treaty of Union in Scotland, was therefore agreed in 1707, creating the Kingdom of Great Britain.
    </span></span>
	Although Scotland was no longer an independent country, it kept its own legal and education systems and Presbyterian Church.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_60">The Prime Minister</h3>
<p>
    <span id="840">
    When Queen Anne died in 1714, Parliament chose a German, George I, to be the next king, because he was Anne's nearest
    Protestant relative. An attempt by Scottish Jacobites to put James II's son on the throne instead was quickly
    defeated. George I did not speak very good English and this increased his need to rely on his ministers. The most
    important minister in Parliament became known as the Prime Minister.
    </span>
    <span id="366"><span id="130">
        The first man to be called this was Sir Robert Walpole, who was Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742.
    </span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_61">The rebellion of the clans</h3>
<p>
    <span id="862">
        In 1745 there was another attempt to put a Stuart king back on the throne in place of George I's son, George II.
    Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), the grandson of James II, landed in Scotland. He was supported by
    clansmen from the Scottish highlands and raised an army. Charles initially had some successes but was defeated by
    George II's army at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Charles escaped back to Europe.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="449"><span id="176">
    The clans lost a lot of their power and influence after Culloden.
</span></span>
	Chieftains became landlords if they had the favour of the English king, and clansmen became tenants who had to pay for the land they used.
</p>
<p><span id="270"><span id="463">
    A process began which became known as the 'Highland Clearances'. Many Scottish landlords destroyed individual small
    farms (known as 'crofts') to make space for large flocks of sheep and cattle. Evictions became very common in the
    early 19th century. Many Scottish people left for North America at this time.

<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Robert Burns (1759-96)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="798"><span id="490"><span id="8">
        Known in Scotland as 'The Bard', Robert Burns was a Scottish poet.
        He wrote in the Scots language, English with some Scottish words, and standard English. He also revised a lot of traditional folk songs by changing
    or adding lyrics. Burns' best-known work is probably the song <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>, which is sung by people in the
    UK and other countries when they are celebrating the <span id="228">New Year (or Hogmanay as it is called in Scotland).</span>
    </span></span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_62">The Enlightenment</h3>
<p><span id="80">
    During the 18th century, new ideas about politics, philosophy and science were developed. This is often called 'the Enlightenment'.
</span>
	Many of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment were Scottish.
    <span id="271"><span id="584">
        Adam Smith developed ideas about economics which are still referred to today.
    </span></span>
	<span id="61">David Hume's ideas about human nature continue to influence philosophers.</span>
	Scientific discoveries, such as <span id="706">James Watt's <span id="106">work on steam power, helped the progress of the Industrial Revolution.</span>
    </span>
    <span id="255">One of the most important principles of the Enlightenment was that everyone should have the
    right to their own political and religious beliefs and that the state should not try to dictate to them. This
        continues to be an important principle in the UK today.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_63">The Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>Before the 18th century, agriculture was the biggest source of employment in Britain. There were many cottage
	industries, where people worked from home to produce goods such as cloth and lace.
</p>
<p><span id="394">
    The Industrial Revolution was the rapid development of industry in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries. Britain
    was the first country to industrialise on a large scale. It happened because of the development of machinery and the
    use of steam power. Agriculture and the manufacturing of goods became mechanised.
</span>
	This made things more efficient
	and increased production. Coal and other raw materials were needed to power the new factories. Many people moved
	from the countryside and started working in the mining and manufacturing industries.
</p>
<p><span id="754"><span id="153">
    The development of the Bessemer process for the mass production of steel led to the development of the shipbuilding
    industry and the railways. Manufacturing jobs became the main source of employment in Britain.
</span></span>
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Richard Arkwright (1732-92)</h4>
<p class="box">Born in 1732, Arkwright originally trained and worked as a barber. He was able to dye hair and make wigs.
	When wigs became less popular, he started to work in textiles. He improved the original carding machine. Carding is
	the process of preparing fibres for spinning into yarn and fabric. He also developed horse-driven spinning mills
	that used only one machine. This increased the efficiency of production. Later, he used the steam engine to power
	machinery.
	<span id="324">Arkwright is particularly remembered for the efficient and profitable way that he ran his factories.</span>
</p>
<p>Better transport links were needed to transport raw materials and manufactured goods. Canals were built to link the
	factories to towns and cities and to the ports, particularly in the new industrial areas in the middle and north of
	England.</p>
<p><span id="177">Working conditions during the Industrial Revolution were very poor. There were no laws to protect employees, who were
    often forced to work long hours in dangerous situations. Children also worked and were treated in the same way as
    adults. Sometimes they were treated even more harshly.</span></p>
<p>This was also a time of increased colonisation overseas. <span id="31">Captain James Cook mapped the coast of Australia and a few
    colonies were established there.</span> Britain gained control over Canada, and the East India Company, originally set up
	to trade, gained control of large parts of India. Colonies began to be established in southern Africa.</p>
<p>Britain traded all over the world and began to import more goods. Sugar and tobacco came from North America and the
	West Indies; textiles, tea and spices came from India and the area that is today called Indonesia. Trading and
	settlements overseas sometimes brought Britain into conflict with other countries, particularly France, which was
	expanding and trading in a similar way in many of the same areas of the world.</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Sake Dean Mahomet (1759-1851)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="296">
        Sake Dean Mahomet was born in 1759 and grew up in the Bengal region of India. He served in the Bengal army and came
    to Britain in 1782. He then moved to Ireland and eloped with an Irish girl called Jane Daly in 1786, returning to
    England at the turn of the century. In 1810 he opened the Hindoostane Coffee House in George Street, London.
    It was the first curry house to open in Britain. Mahomet and his wife also introduced 'shampooing',
        the Indian art of head massage, to Britain.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_64">The slave trade</h3>
<p>This commercial expansion and prosperity was sustained in part by the booming slave trade. While slavery was illegal
	within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry, dominated by Britain and
	the American colonies. <span id="272">Slaves came primarily from West Africa. Travelling on British ships in horrible conditions,
    they were taken to America and the Caribbean, where they were made to work on tobacco and sugar plantations. The
    living and working conditions for slaves were very bad. Many slaves tried to escape and others revolted against
        their owners in protest at their terrible treatment.</span>
</p>
<p>There were, however, people in Britain who opposed the slave trade.
	<span id="131">The first formal anti-slavery groups were set up by the Quakers in the late 1700s, and they petitioned Parliament to ban the practice.</span>
	William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian and a member of Parliament, also played an important part in changing the law.
    <span id="297">Along with other abolitionists (people who supported the abolition of slavery), he succeeded in turning public opinion against the slave trade.
        <span id="728"><span id="345">In 1807, it became illegal to trade slaves in British ships or from British
            ports, and in 1833 the Emancipation Act abolished slavery throughout the British Empire.
        </span>
        </span>
    </span>
	The Royal Navy stopped slave ships from other countries, freed the slaves and punished the slave traders.
    <span id="491">After 1833, 2 million Indian and Chinese workers were employed to replace the freed slaves.
        They worked on sugar plantations in the Caribbean, in mines in South Africa, on railways in East Africa and in
        the army in Kenya.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_65">The American war of independence</h3>
<p>
    <span id="956">
        By the 1760s, there were substantial British colonies in North America. The colonies were wealthy and largely in
    control of their own affairs. Many of the colonist families had originally gone to North America in order to have
    religious freedom. They were well educated and interested in ideas of liberty. The British government wanted to tax
    the colonies. The colonists saw this as an attack on their freedom and said there should be 'no taxation without
    representation' in the British Parliament. Parliament tried to compromise by repealing some of the taxes, but
    relationships between the British government and the colonies continued to worsen. Fighting broke out between the
    colonists and the British forces.
    </span>
    <span id="783"><span id="412"><span id="107">
            In 1776, 13 American colonies declared their independence, stating that people had
    a right to establish their own governments.
        <span id="346">
            The colonists eventually defeated the British army and Britain recognised the colonies' independence in 1783.
        </span>
    </span></span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_66">War with France</h3>
<p><span id="830">
	During the 18th century, Britain fought a number of wars with France. In 1789, there was a revolution in France and
    the new French government soon declared war on Britain. Napoleon, who became Emperor of France, continued the war.
</span>
    <span id="178">
        Britain's navy fought against combined French and Spanish fleets, winning the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
    </span>
	<span id="1001">Admiral Nelson was in charge of the British fleet at Trafalgar and was killed in the battle. Nelson's
		Column in Trafalgar Square, London, is a monument to him. His ship, <span id="81">HMS Victory, can be visited in Portsmouth.</span>
	</span>
	The British army also fought against the French.
    <span id="256">
        In 1815, the French Wars ended with the defeat of the Emperor Napoleon by the Duke of
        Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.
    </span>
	Wellington was known as the Iron Duke and later became Prime Minister.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">The Union Flag</h4>
<p class="box">Although Ireland had had the same monarch as England and Wales since Henry VIII, it had remained a
	separate country. In 1801,
    <span id="15"><span id="62"><span id="393">
        Ireland became unified with England, Scotland and Wales after the Act of Union of 1800.
    This created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. One symbol of this union between England, Scotland,
        Wales and Ireland was a new version of the official flag, the Union Flag. This is often called the Union Jack.
        <span id="417">The flag combined crosses associated with England, Scotland and Ireland.</span>
        It is still used today as the official flag of the UK.
    </span></span></span>

</p>
<div class="box">The Union Flag consists of three crosses:</div>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li class="box">The cross of St George, patron saint of England, is a red cross on a white ground.</li>
		<li class="box">
			<span id="9">The cross of <span id="137">St Andrew</span>, patron saint of Scotland, is a diagonal white cross on a blue ground.</span>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<span id="492">The cross of St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, is a diagonal red cross on a white ground.</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="box">
    <span id="450"><span id="807">
        There is also an official Welsh flag, which shows a Welsh dragon. The Welsh dragon does not appear on
        the Union Flag because, when the first Union Flag was created in 1606 from the flags of Scotland and England, the
        Principality of Wales was already united with England.

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_67">The Victorian Age</h3>
<p>
    <span id="796"><span id="229">
        In 1837, Queen Victoria became queen of the UK at the age of 18. She reigned until 1901, almost 64 years.
        This was the longest reign of any British monarch until Queen Elizabeth recently completed more than 65 years of reign.
        Victoria's reign is known as the Victorian Age. It was
        a time when Britain increased in power and influence abroad. Within the UK, the middle classes because increasingly
        significant and a number of reformers led moves to improve conditions of life for the poor.
    </span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_68">The British Empire</h3>
<p>
    <span id="655"><span id="132">
        During the Victorian period, the British Empire grew to cover all of India, Australia and large parts of Africa. It
        became the largest empire the world has ever seen, with an estimated population of more than 400 million people.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p>Many people were encouraged to leave the UK to settle overseas. Between 1853 and 1913, as many as 13 million British
	citizens left the country. People continued to come to Britain from other parts of the world. For example, <span id="257">between
    1870 and 1914, around 120,000 Russian and Polish Jews came to Britain to escape persecution. Many settled in
        London's East End and in Manchester and Leeds.</span>
	People from the Empire, including India and Africa, also came to Britain to live, work and study.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_69">Trade and industry</h3>
<p>
	<span id="154">
		Britain continued to be a great trading nation. The government began to promote policies of free trade, abolishing a
	number of taxes on imported goods. One example of this was the repealing of the Corn Laws in 1846. These had prevented the import of cheap grain.
	The reforms helped the development of British industry, because raw materials could now be imported more cheaply.
		</span>
</p>
<p>Working conditions in factories gradually became better. In 1847, the number of hours that women and children could
	work was limited by law to 10 hours per day. Better housing began to be built for workers.</p>
<p>
    <span id="797">
        Transport links also improved, enabling goods and people to move more easily around the country. Just before Victoria
        came to the throne, the father and son George and Robert Stephenson pioneered the railway engine and a major
        expansion of the railways took place in the Victorian period.
    </span>
	Railways were built throughout the Empire. There were
	also great advances in other areas, such as the building of bridges by engineers such as Isambard Kingdom
	Brunel.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">
	<span id="108">Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-59)</span>
</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="370">
        Brunel was originally from Portsmouth, England. He was an engineer who built tunnels, bridges, railway
    lines and ships. He was responsible for constructing the Great Western Railway, which was the first major railway
    built in Britain.
    </span>
	It runs from Paddington Station in London to the south west of England, the West Midlands and
	Wales. Many of Brunel's bridges are still in use today.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="452">
        British industry led the world in the 19th century. The UK produced more than half of the world's iron, coal and
    cotton cloth. The UK also became a centre for financial services, including insurance and banking.
    </span>
	In 1851, the Great Exhibition opened in Hyde Park in the Crystal Palace, a huge building made of steel and glass. Exhibits ranged
	from huge machines to handmade goods. Countries from all over the world showed their goods but most of the objects
	were made in Britain.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_70">The Crimean War</h3>
<p>
    <span id="364"><span id="465">
        From 1853 to 1856, Britain fought with Turkey and France against Russia in the Crimean War. It was the first war to
    be extensively covered by the media through news stories and photographs. The conditions were very poor and many
    soldiers died from illnesses they caught in the hospitals, rather than from war wounds.
    </span></span>
    <span id="179">
        Queen Victoria introduced the Victoria Cross medal during this war. It honours acts of valour by soldiers.

<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="63">
        Florence Nightingale was born in Italy to English parents.
    </span>
    <span id="439">At the age of 31, she trained as a nurse in Germany.
    </span>
	In 1854, she went to Turkey and worked in military hospitals, treating soldiers who were fighting in the
	Crimean War. She and her fellow nurses improved the conditions in the hospital and reduced the mortality rate. In
	1860 she established the Nightingale Training School for nurses at St Thomas' Hospital in London. The school was the
	first of its kind and still exists today, as do many of the practices that Florence used. She is often regarded as
	the founder of modern nursing.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_71">Ireland in the 19th century</h3>
<p>
    <span id="704">
        Conditions in Ireland were not as good as in the rest of the UK.
        <span id="230">
            Two-thirds of the population still depended on farming to make their living, often on very small plots of land.
            Many depended on potatoes as a large part of their diet.
        </span>
            In the middle of the century the potato crop failed, and Ireland suffered a famine. A million people died from
            disease and starvation. Another million and a half left Ireland. Some emigrated to the United States and others came
            to England. By 1861 there were large populations of Irish people in cities such as Liverpool, London, Manchester and Glasgow.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="815">
    The Irish Nationalist movement had grown strongly through the 19th century. Some, such as the Fenians, favoured
    complete independence. Others, such as Charles Stuart Parnell, advocated 'Home Rule', in which Ireland would remain
    in the UK but have its own parliament.
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_72">The right to vote</h3>
<p>As the middle classes in the wealthy industrial towns and cities grew in influence, they began to demand more
	political power.
    <span id="689">
			The Reform Act of 1832 had greatly increased the number of people with the right to vote. The Act
			also abolished the old pocket and rotten boroughs (see Constitutional Monarchy - The Bill of Rights) and more
			parliamentary seats were given to the towns and cities.
			There was a permanent shift of political power from the
			countryside to the towns but voting was still based on ownership of property. This meant that members of the working
			class were still unable to vote.
    </span>
</p>
<p>A movement began to demand the vote for the working classes and other people without property. Campaigners, called
	the Chartists, presented petitions to Parliament. At first they seemed to be unsuccessful, but in 1867 there was
	another Reform Act. This created many more urban seats in Parliament and reduced the amount of property that people
	needed to have before they could vote. However, the majority of men still did not have the right to vote and no
	women could vote.
</p>
<p>Politicians realised that the increased number of voters meant that they needed to persuade people to vote for them
	if they were to be sure of being elected to Parliament. The political parties began to create organisations to reach
	out to ordinary voters. Universal suffrage (the right of every adult, male or female, to vote) followed in the next
	century.
</p>
<p>In common with the rest of Europe, women in 19th century Britain had fewer rights than men. Until 1870, when a woman
	got married, her earnings, property and money automatically belonged to her husband. Acts of Parliament in 1870 and
	1882 gave wives the right to keep their own earnings and property.
    <span id="273">
        In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an increasing number of women campaigned and demonstrated
        for greater rights and, in particular, the right to vote. They formed the women's suffrage movement and became
        known as 'suffragettes'.
    </span>
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Emmeline Pankhurst (1858-1928)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="388">
        Emmeline Pankhurst was born in Manchester in 1858. She set up the Women's Franchise League in 1889, which
    fought to get the vote in local elections for married women.
    </span>
    <span id="950">
    In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst helped found the Women's Social and
    Political Union (WSPU). This was the first group whose members were called 'suffragettes'. The group used civil
    disobedience as part of their protest to gain the vote for women. They chained themselves to railings, smashed
    windows and committed arson. Many of the women, including Emmeline, went on hunger strike.
    </span>
    <span id="506">In 1918, women over the age of 30 were given voting rights and the right to stand for Parliament,
        partly in recognition of the contribution women made to the war effort during the First World War. Shortly before
        Emmeline's death in 1928, women were given the right to vote at the age of 21, the same as men.
    </span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_73">The future of the Empire</h3>
<p>Although the British Empire continued to grow until the 1920s, there was already discussion in the late 19th century
	about its future direction. Supporters of expansion believed that the Empire benefited Britain through increased
	trade and commerce. Others thought the Empire had become over-expanded and that the frequent conflicts in many parts
	of the Empire, such as India's north-west frontier or southern Africa, were a drain on resources. Yet the great
	majority of British people believed in the Empire as a force for good in the world.
</p>
<p>
    <span id="772"><span id="753">
        The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 made the discussions about the future of the Empire more urgent. The British went to war
        in South Africa with settlers from the Netherlands called the Boers. The Boers fought fiercely and the war went on
        for over three years. Many died in the fighting and many more from disease. There was some public sympathy for the
        Boers and people began to question whether the Empire could continue.
    </span></span>
	As different parts of the Empire developed,
	they won greater freedom and autonomy from Britain. Eventually, by the second half of the 20th century, there was,
	for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their
	independence.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_75">The 20th century</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_76">The First World War</h3>
<p>
    <span id="828">
        The early 20th century was a time of optimism in Britain. The nation, with its expansive Empire, well-admired navy,
    thriving industry and strong political institutions, was what is now known as a global 'superpower'. It was also a
    time of social progress. Financial help for the unemployed, old-age pensions and free school meals were just a few
    of the important measures introduced.
    </span>
	Various laws were passed to improve safety in the workplace; town planning
	rules were tightened to prevent the further development of slums; and better support was given to mothers and their
	children after divorce or separation. Local government became more democratic and a salary for members of Parliament
	(MPs) was introduced for the first time, making it easier for more people to take part in public life.
</p>
<p>This era of optimism and progress was cut short when war broke out between several European nations.
    <span id="64">On 28 June 1914,
    Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. This set off a chain of events leading to the First World War
    (1914-18).
    </span>
	But while the assassination provided the trigger for war, other factors - such as a growing sense of
	nationalism in many European states; increasing militarism; imperialism; and the division of the major European
	powers into two camps - all set the conditions for war.
</p>
<p>The conflict was centred in Europe, but it was a global war involving nations from around the world. Britain was part
	of the Allied Powers, which included (amongst others) France, Russia, Japan, Belgium, Serbia - and later, Greece,
	Italy, Romania and the United States. The whole of the British Empire was involved in the conflict - for example,
	more than a million Indians fought on behalf of Britain in lots of different countries, and around 40,000 were
	killed. Men from the West Indies, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also fought with the British.
    <span id="759">
    The Allies fought against the Central Powers - mainly Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and later
        Bulgaria. Millions of people were killed or wounded, with more than 2 million British casualties.
    </span>
	One battle,
	<span id="389">the British attack on the Somme in July 1916, resulted in about 60,000 British casualties on the first day alone.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="530"><span id="466">
        The First World War ended at 11.00 am on 11th November 1918 with victory for Britain and its allies.
    </span></span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_77">The partition of Ireland</h3>
<span id="975">
<p>
	In 1913, the British government promised 'Home Rule' for Ireland. The proposal was to have a self-governing Ireland
	with its own parliament but still part of the UK. A Home Rule Bill was introduced in Parliament. It was opposed by
	the Protestants in the north of Ireland, who threatened to resist Home Rule by force.
</p>
<p>The outbreak of the First World War led the British government to postpone any changes in Ireland. Irish Nationalists
	were not willing to wait and in 1916 there was an uprising (the Easter Rising) against the British in Dublin. The
	leaders of the uprising were executed under military law. A guerrilla war against the British army and the police in
	Ireland followed.
    <span id="82"><span id="554"><span id="323">
        In 1921 a peace treaty was signed and in 1922 Ireland became two countries.
        The six counties in the north which were mainly Protestant remained part of the UK under the name Northern Ireland. The rest of Ireland
        became the Irish Free State. It had its own government and became a republic in 1949.
    </span></span></span>
</p>
</span>
<p><span id="578">
    There were people in both parts of Ireland who disagreed with the split between the North and the South. They still
    wanted Ireland to be one independent country. Years of disagreement led to a terror campaign in Northern Ireland and
    elsewhere. The conflict between those wishing for full Irish independence and those wishing to remain loyal to the
    British government is often referred to as 'the Troubles'.
</span>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_78">The inter-war period</h3>
<p>In the 1920s, many people's living conditions got better. There were improvements in public housing and new homes
	were built in many towns and cities. However, in 1929, the world entered the 'Great Depression' and some parts of
	the UK suffered mass unemployment.
    <span id="809">
        The effects of the depression of the 1930s were felt differently in different
        parts of the UK. The traditional heavy industries such as shipbuilding were badly affected but new industries -
        including the automobile and aviation industries - developed. As prices generally fell, those in work had more money
        to spend. Car ownership doubled from 1 million to 2 million between 1930 and 1939.
    </span>
	In addition, many new houses were built. It was also a time of cultural blossoming, with writers such as Graham Greene
	and Evelyn Waugh prominent. The economist John Maynard Keynes published influential new theories of economics.

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_79">The Second World War</h3>
<p>Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. He believed that the conditions imposed on Germany by the Allies after
	the First World War were unfair; he also wanted to conquer more land for the German people. He set about
	renegotiating treaties, building up arms, and testing Germany's military strength in nearby countries. The British
	government tried to avoid another war. However,
    <span id="782">
        when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war in order to stop his aggression.
    </span>
</p>
<p><span id="494">The war was initially fought between the Axis powers (fascist Germany and Italy and the Empire of Japan) and the
    Allies. The main countries on the allied side were the UK, France, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the
    Union of South Africa.
</span>
</p>
<span id="32">
<p>
	Having occupied Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, Hitler followed his invasion of Poland by taking control of
	Belgium and the Netherlands. Then, in 1940, German forces defeated allied troops and advanced through France. At
	this time of national crisis, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister and Britain's war leader.
</p>
</span>
<p>
    <span id="799"><span id="180">
    As France fell, the British decided to evacuate British and French soldiers from France in a huge naval operation.
    Many civilian volunteers in small pleasure and fishing boats from Britain helped the Navy to rescue more than
    300,000 men from the beaches around Dunkirk. Although many lives and a lot of equipment were lost, the evacuation
    was a success and meant that Britain was better able to continue the fight against the Germans. The evacuation gave
    rise to the phrase 'the Dunkirk spirit'.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p>From the end of June 1940 until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain and the Empire stood
	almost alone against Nazi Germany.
</p>
<p><span id="333">
    Hitler wanted to invade Britain, but before sending in troops, Germany needed to control the air. The Germans waged
    an air campaign against Britain, but the British resisted with their fighter planes and eventually won the crucial
    aerial battle against the Germans, called 'the Battle of Britain', in the summer of 1940.
</span>
    <span id="453">
        The most important planes used by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain were the Spitfire and the
        Hurricane - which were designed and built in Britain.
    </span>
    <span id="705"><span id="109">
        Despite this crucial victory, the German air force was able to continue bombing London and other
        British cities at night-time. This was called the Blitz.
    </span></span>
	Coventry was almost totally destroyed and a great deal of
	damage was done in other cities, especially in the East End of London. Despite the destruction, there was a strong
	national spirit of resistance in the UK. The phrase 'the Blitz spirit' is still used today to describe Britons
	pulling together in the face of adversity.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Winston Churchill (1874-1965)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="555">
        Churchill was the son of a politician and, before becoming a Conservative MP in 1900, was a soldier and
    journalist. In May 1940 he became Prime Minister. He refused to surrender to the Nazis and was an inspirational
    leader to the British people in a time of great hardship. He lost the General Election in 1945 but returned as Prime
    Minister in 1951.
    </span>
</p>
<p class="box">He was an MP until he stood down at the 1964 General Election. Following his death in 1965, he was given
	a state funeral.
    <span id="395">He remains a much-admired figure to this day, and in 2002 was voted the greatest Briton of all time by the public.
    </span>
</p>
<span id="468">During the War, he made many famous speeches including lines which you may still hear:
    <p class="box">'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat'</p>
    <p class="box">Churchill's first speech to the House of Commons after he became Prime Minister, 1940</p>
    <p class="box">'We shall fight on the beaches,</p>
    <p class="box">we shall fight on the landing grounds,</p>
    <p class="box">we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,</p>
    <p class="box">we shall fight in the hills;</p>
    <p class="box">we shall never surrender'</p>
    <p class="box">Speech to the House of Commons after Dunkirk (see above), 1940</p>
    <p class="box">'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few'</p>
    <p class="box">Speech to the House of Commons during the Battle of Britain (see above), 1940</p>
</span>
<p>At the same time as defending Britain, the British military was fighting the Axis on many other fronts. In Singapore,
	the Japanese defeated the British and then occupied Burma, threatening India. The United States entered the war when
	the Japanese bombed its naval base at Pearl Harbour in December 1941.</p>
<p>That same year, Hitler attempted the largest invasion in history by attacking the Soviet Union. It was a fierce
	conflict, with huge losses on both sides. German forces were ultimately repelled by the Soviets, and the damage they
	sustained proved to be a pivotal point in the war.</p>
<p>The allied forces gradually gained the upper hand, winning significant victories in North Africa and Italy. German
	losses in the Soviet Union, combined with the support of the Americans, meant that the Allies were eventually strong
	enough to attack Hitler's forces in Western Europe.
    <span id="396"><span id="258">
        On 6 June 1944, allied forces landed in Normandy (this event is often referred to as 'D-Day').
    </span>
        <span id="579">
            Following victory on the beaches of Normandy, the allied forces pressed on through
            France and eventually into Germany. The Allies comprehensively defeated Germany in May 1945.
        </span>
    </span>
</p>
<p>The war against Japan ended in August 1945 when the United States dropped its newly developed atom bombs on the
	Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
    <span id="495">
        Scientists led by Ernest Rutherford, working at Manchester and then
    Cambridge University, were the first to 'split the atom' and took part in the Manhattan Project in the United
        States, which developed the atomic bomb.
    </span> The war was finally over.

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_81">Britain since 1945</h2>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_82">The welfare state</h3>
<p>Although the UK had won the war, the country was exhausted economically and the people wanted change. During the war,
	there had been significant reforms to the education system and people now looked for wider social reforms.</p>
<p><span id="321">
    In 1945 the British people elected a Labour government. The new Prime Minister was Clement Atlee, who promised to
    introduce the welfare state outlined in the Beveridge Report.
</span>
    <span id="817">
    In 1948, Aneurin (Nye) Bevan, the Minister for Health,
    led the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS), which guaranteed a minimum standard of health care for
    all, free at the point of use. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide 'social security', so
    that the population would be protected from the 'cradle to the grave'. The government took into public ownership
    (nationalised) the railways, coal mines and gas, water and electricity supplies.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="298">
        Another aspect of change was self-government for former colonies.
        <span id="769">
            In 1947, independence was granted to nine countries, including India, Pakistan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).
            Other colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific achieved independence over the next 20 years.
    </span></span>
</p>
<p>The UK developed its own atomic bomb and joined the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance of
	nations set up to resist the perceived threat of invasion by the Soviet Union and its allies.</p>
<p>Britain had a Conservative government from 1951 to 1964. The 1950s were a period of economic recovery after the war
	and increasing prosperity for working people. The Prime Minister of the day, Harold Macmillan, was famous for his
	'wind of change' speech about decolonisation and independence for the countries of the Empire.</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Clement Attlee (1883-1967)</h4>
<p class="box">Clement Attlee was born in London in 1883. His father was a solicitor and, after studying at Oxford
	University, Attlee became a barrister. He gave this up to do social work in East London and eventually became a
	Labour MP. He was Winston Churchill's Deputy Prime Minister in the wartime coalition government and became Prime
	Minister after the <span id="800">Labour Party won the 1945 election.</span>
    <span id="110">
        He was Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951 and led the Labour Party for 20 years
    </span>.
	Attlee's government undertook the nationalisation of major industries (like coal and steel),
	created the National Health Service and implemented many of Beveridge's plans for a stronger welfare state. Attlee
	also introduced measures to improve the conditions of workers.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">William Beveridge (1879-1963)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="814">
        William Beveridge (later Lord Beveridge) was a British economist and social reformer. He served briefly
    as a Liberal MP and was subsequently the leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords but is best known for the 1942
    report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report). The report was commissioned by the
    wartime government in 1941. It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the five 'Giant Evils'
    of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness and provided the basis of the modern welfare state.

</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">R A Butler (1902-82)</h4>
<p class="box">
    <span id="362"><span id="334">
        Richard Austen Butler (later Lord Butler) was born in 1902. He became a Conservative MP in 1923 and held
        several positions before becoming responsible for education in 1941. In this role, he oversaw the introduction of
        the Education Act 1944 (often called 'The Butler Act'), which introduced free secondary education in England and
        Wales.
    </span></span>
	The education system has changed significantly since the Act was introduced, but the division between primary
	and secondary schools that it enforced still remains in most areas of Britain.
</p>
<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Dylan Thomas (1914-53)</h4>
<p class="box">Dylan Thomas was a Welsh poet and writer. He often read and performed his work in public, including for
	the BBC. His most well-known works include the radio play Under Milk Wood, first performed after his death in 1954,
	and the poem Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, which he wrote for his dying father in 1952. He died at the age
	of 39 in New York. There are several memorials to him in his birthplace, Swansea, including a statue and the Dylan
	Thomas Centre.</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_83">Migration in post-war Britain</h3>
<p>Rebuilding Britain after the Second World War was a huge task. There were labour shortages and the British government
	encouraged workers from Ireland and other parts of Europe to come to the UK and help with the reconstruction. In
	1948, people from the West Indies were also invited to come and work.</p>
<p>
    <span id="274">
    During the 1950s, there was still a shortage of labour in the UK. Further immigration was therefore encouraged for
    economic reasons, and many industries advertised for workers from overseas.
    </span>
	For example, centres were set up in the West Indies to recruit people to drive buses. Textile and engineering firms from the north of England and the
	Midlands sent agents to India and Pakistan to find workers. For about 25 years, people from the West Indies, India,
	Pakistan and (later) Bangladesh travelled to work and settle in Britain.
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_84">Social change in the 1960s</h3>
<p>
    <span id="83">
    The decade of the 1960s was a period of significant social change. It was known as 'the Swinging Sixties'.
    There was growth in British fashion, cinema and popular music.
    Two well-known pop music groups at the time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.
    People started to become better off and many bought cars and other consumer goods.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span id="867">
    It was also a time when social laws were liberalised, for example in relation to divorce and to abortion in England,
    Wales and Scotland. The position of women in the workplace also improved. It was quite common at the time for
    employers to ask women to leave their jobs when they got married, but Parliament passed new laws giving women the
    right to equal pay and made it illegal for employers to discriminate against women because of their gender.
    </span>
</p>
<p>The 1960s was also a time of technological progress. Britain and France developed the world's only supersonic
	commercial airliner, Concorde. New styles of architecture, including high-rise buildings and the use of concrete and
	steel, became common.
</p>
<p>The number of people migrating from the West Indies, India, Pakistan and what is now Bangladesh fell in the late
	1960s because the government passed new laws to restrict immigration to Britain. Immigrants were required to have a
	strong connection to Britain through birth or ancestry. Even so, during the early 1970s, Britain admitted 28,000
	people of Indian origin who had been forced to leave Uganda.

<h4 class="box sigil_not_in_toc">Some great British inventions of the 20th century</h4>

<p class="box">
    <span id="775">
    The <b>structure of the DNA molecule</b> was discovered in 1953 through work at British universities in
    London and Cambridge. This discovery contributed to many scientific advances, particularly in medicine and fighting
    crime. Francis Crick (1916-2004), one of those awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, was British.
</span>
</p>
<p class="box">
    <span id="960">
        The <b>jet engine</b> was developed in Britain in the 1930s by Sir Frank Whittle (1907-96), a British

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_85">Problems in the economy in the 1970s</h3>
<p>In the late 1970s, the post-war economic boom came to an end. Prices of goods and raw materials began to rise sharply
	and the exchange rate between the pound and other currencies was unstable. This caused problems with the 'balance of
	payments': imports of goods were valued at more than the price paid for exports.</p>
<p>Many industries and services were affected by strikes and this caused problems between the trade unions and the
	government. People began to argue that the unions were too powerful and that their activities were harming the
	UK.</p>
<p><span id="558"><span id="320"><span id="497">
    The 1970s were also a time of serious unrest in Northern Ireland. In 1972, the Northern Ireland Parliament was

<p><span id="96">
    Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman Prime Minister, led the Conservative government from 1979 to 1990.
</span>
	The government made structural changes to the economy through the privatisation of nationalised industries and imposed
